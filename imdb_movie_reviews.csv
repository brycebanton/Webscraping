 Laugh Out Loud Funny S#!^!,10,151,233,YourSonsDad,28 October 2020,What's even funnier than the movie itself; is seeing people cry about it. I mean; damn; Cohen just exposes the stuff; he doesn't make them say or do what they say and do. If you're mad at anyone; be mad at the buffoons caught on tape. Or on second thought; keep being mad here; cause its hella hilarious.Great movie. Had richer; deeper laughs than the first; though not as many. Plus; it's on Amazon; so you can basically watch it for what you already pay or get yourself a free trial.Great s#!^!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213611/?ref_=tt_urv
 Excellent. And this is from a non Sasha Cohen Baron fan. REAL REVIEW.,10,129,199,lvanka,30 October 2020,My husband loved SCB in all his incarnations (Ali G.; Borat; Bruno; and that guy from Who is America). He'd quote parts of Bruno ("But first; more dancing with Bruno!") as he'd dance around me in the kitchen. He'd quote parts of an interview SCB did with Dick Cheney; as I rolled my eyes. Every couple of years or so; he'd put on Bruno or Borat; and laugh; and laugh; while I just shook my head. In short; he reverted from a mature 35 year old man; into a a teen; because of this one comedian. I kind of hated it and really didn't see the appeal of Cohen's comedy which I found crude and sometimes downright offensive (i.e.; "In my country; they would go crazy for these two. That one; not so much."). Until this Borat 2020 film; that is.Knowing he was such a fan; the evening of the day the film came out; I grilled him a porterhouse steak in bourbon and pecans; with a baked potato smothered in broccoli and cheese sauce; and relegated myself to sit through this new Borat without looking too bored or condescending.Two things happened.One; my husband; laughed several times; of course; but he did so less heartily than he had at most of SCB's prior work; and he never rewinded it to re-watch an especially funny part.Two; I loved it.This Borat film is hilarious!!! And not only is it both; in your face; and subtly hilarious; but it has sooo much heart; it nearly brought me to tears. Even the infinitely ill-informed guys he quarantined with; made me want to go out and hug a redneck.So; if you're here wondering whether you should watch it (although I don't think that's what anyone does anymore); I suggest you do so. The worst that can happen is that you'll laugh. Since when is that a bad thing? The best that can happen is that you'll laugh and cry at seeing the United States in such a dire and chaotic state; and so far from united; that you will walk away with a desire to one day make it united; as the greatest gift ever to ourselves and our kids.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6219436/?ref_=tt_urv
 Cohen is a genius,10,205,325,WindsOfWintergreen,27 October 2020,For those saying Giuliani was just tucking in his shirt; why lay down on a bed to do so instead of STANDING UP? And that; folks; is part of the genius of this film: that is shows you; live on video what's going on; and lets those who want to continue to lie to themselves; to continue to do so; while being laughed at by others. Don't miss it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6210276/?ref_=tt_urv
 The 10's are 10's & The 1's are 10's!,10,181,294,AnaAnaBanana,27 October 2020,Nothing more needs to be said than: LOOK at the 1 ratings and the vehemence (and bad English) with which they try to dissuade you from watching Borat 2! You KNOW it has to be good.WATCH it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6211296/?ref_=tt_urv
 He's back,9,408,714,cartsghammond,23 October 2020,Borat is back; with this subsequent moviefilm.
This will be compared to the original to no end; but with borat being a cultural icon in America; this one was bound to be very different.I loved this film; it made me topple with laughter multiple times. The accomplishment of making this within a pandemic is also a massive achievement.
Do I think this is better then the first one? No.
Do I think this is a hilarious movie? Absolutely.This one seems a lot more planned narratively and has a lot more scripted scenes; not bad things at all.
The girl playing borat's daughter was also great.Very nice!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197576/?ref_=tt_urv
 A Must-Watch!,10,176,300,Her-Excellency,27 October 2020,The Giuliani portion alone; makes this a must-watch. Can this administration get any CREEPIER? Why yes; it can!Speaking of .... the Fertility Dance; alone; is yet another reason to watch. It is not for the feint of heart; but it is like nothing (hopefully); you've ever seen before; or (hopefully); that you will ever see again.The rest is just icing ... and cake ... and a cherry. Maria Bakalova is ridiculously ADORABLE. Jeanise Jones is all heart.STOP CRYING; you insipid detractors! Relax just a little and LAUGH!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6209636/?ref_=tt_urv
 Anybody in power should fear Sacha Baron Cohen,10,391,692,dylanmoogatt-28263,23 October 2020,Let's start by saying that Cohen has been notorious for pointing out political and social problems in society with most of the films he has been attributed to.Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is no different.His penchant for trolling not only the general public but those in power in this movie is on a whole other level to anything he has done in the past.If you were a fan of the original 2006 Borat film; don't expect something exactly the same. This movie felt more refined with less filler and feels much more relevant to the things we are going through today from politics to COVID to human rights and equality.There will be those who say "this is a stupid film" based on face value. However; when you break it down to what Cohen tried to do all you can do afterwards is just picture how stupid some of the people in this movie are going to (and already do) feel *cough* Rudolph Giuliana *cough* and you'll understand exactly why nobody can match Sacha Baron Cohen in the art of making people look incredibly stupid.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197615/?ref_=tt_urv
 This movie DESERVES the bad reviews!!,10,306,539,diegosays,24 October 2020,If you love Borat; you will understand that the bad reviews are the best reviews. Sacha Baron Cohen threw a bomb in our actual society... And I LOVED IT.
Every sensitive issue that exists today; Cohen broke it with nothing more than the truth that is so much being concealed.
Even if the scenes are fake; he talked about subjects that no one really wanted to talk; and that's why this movie is going to get controversial and some people will obviously hate it. But that was its objective and it means Sacha Baron Cohen did an amazing job.
I would write a longer review about this incredible movie; but it's about those who see it that will know this movie is indisputably amazing.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201438/?ref_=tt_urv
 Jagshemash!,6,317,569,matianero,23 October 2020,Not as good as the first one (it doesn't even come close); but still very funny at times. The actress who plays the daughter could be the next big thing; she is fantastic in her role.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198186/?ref_=tt_urv
 I was excite, but now I am dissapoint,4,443,812,FixedYourEnding,23 October 2020,Who doesn't love Borat Sagdiyev; the clueless foreign reporter from Kazakhstan? definitely not me. I love Borat. I also am a BIG fan of Sacha Baron-Cohen; he is a wonderfully nice person and witty; not to say genius; comedian. This is why it is heart-breaking for me to tell you the stone cold truth: this Subsequent moviefilm is one of his worst works; it's even worse than The Dictator that held that title up to this point.Now; if you are a fan of Borat; like me; and you have Amazon streaming; there is nothing in the world that will stop you from watching this (especially it being free) so I think it will get the views; there is not need for all these fanbois 10/10 reviews on this site. This is not a spoiler review; however if you have seen the trailer you have seen everything that this movie has to offer (in fact the trailer have some shots that are not even in the movie itself!) there is no 'uncovering of Americas underbelly' and the worse thing; it's not even funny. Crazy to notice there are 10 names listed as writers list for this thing on top of Cohen himself. Really? maybe just let the comedian do his job? maybe?For some reason; the combination of 'candid camera' action and bad scripted non-candid camera just doesn't work this time. It comes out as a cringe-worthy 90 minutes of overly-gross juvenile humor. Where are all the edgy scenes that we are used to seeing from Baron-Cohen? Just watch Who Is America for some good edgy Baron-Cohen humor. Even better; watch some of the serious work Cohen does in "The Spy" or "The Chicago 7" those are masterpieces who deserve the 8+ ratings they get. This one? neh-eh.Overall; this should be on the bottom of the things you should see from Baron-Cohen if you watched everything else already- sure sit down and watch a mediocre 90 minutes that can be covered in 2 minutes of a trailer. Exact score: 45 / 100,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199408/?ref_=tt_urv
 Pretty disappointing,4,456,847,schroederagustavo,23 October 2020,I can't deny I laughed pretty hard about 2 times and chuckled like 3 times; but most of the movie was a flatliner for me. I am a big fan of the first movie and I think where this one falls apart for me is that it focuses too much on current events (that the movie will probably be irrelevant in a few years); focuses way too much on politics and on the plot with Borat's daughter. Many people are praising her performance here. I think she's fine; but I don't think the script is anything special here and it doesn't help the actors. The scenes I enjoyed the most are those with Borat doing his thing by himself; but a lot of it felt to me like attempting to recreate the mood of the original.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199405/?ref_=tt_urv
 Yes, there ARE English subtitles on Prime,9,217,402,McScared,23 October 2020,IMPORTANT before you begin the MovieFilm go to the subtitles and:
1) Turn on
2) switch to EnglishI realize this sounds obvious; but the default is OFF and the language of Kazakhstan (apparently). I wasted the first 20 minutes missing all the Textual humour because I couldn't understand either the dialogue or text. After a second attempt; I was able to switch the subtitles to English which make the MovieFilm Very Nice.You really need English subtitles. Really. At first; I just thought the foreign subtitles were part of the joke. NOT!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197742/?ref_=tt_urv
 Balls of steel? A'naicccce! High-five ✋,8,119,217,TopDawgCritic,24 October 2020,He must have; getting hammered in the High Striker by a strongman and surviving. In usual Borat fashion; his Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan; was a'naicccce. High-five ✋The 95 min runtime felt longer from being a little slowly paced. I feel about 10 mins edited/cut down (faxing scenes?) would've done some justice.The story was great and flowed smoothly and entertainingly. The Giuliani bit was OMG stellar and will be talked about for many years lol. It was good to see some cameos like Hanks; and novice actress Maria Bakalova was awesome in her role.If you're a fan of Borat; you will love his Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan... I just love saying it lol. Itsa naaaaaaicccce 8/10 from me. High-five! ✋,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202147/?ref_=tt_urv
 Freedom of speech,9,40,67,taseron-1,1 November 2020,I think this movie is a very solid demonstration of freedom of speech in USA and I envy it a lot.
I live in Turkey and I can't imagine such a political satire movie of TR government being shown in our theaters or TVs without getting banned or somehow punished.
American citizens are free to mock their government; president; his wife and their supporters in movies and mainstream media; and they are not labeled as 'traitors' or get arrested for interrogation.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6227128/?ref_=tt_urv
 I mean...,8,265,513,djkaine,23 October 2020,It's Borat. Crude; offensive; and fun. It will probably get a bunch of 1's from the poli-cry-babies who claim they aren't judging it based on the fact that it goes against their values; but they are. It's a stupid comedy and it was entertaining. If you don't like stupid comedies then this just isn't for you.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197667/?ref_=tt_urv
 Average at best,3,414,838,pedopete-37355,23 October 2020,1st borat movie was brilliant because no one knew about the character at the time; this time it was horribly scripted and politically one sided. No where near as funny as the first one,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198518/?ref_=tt_urv
 As a Bulgarian, watching this was an absolute blast.,10,46,81,juujuuuujj,29 October 2020,First of all; this movie is such a pleasure to watch; all audiences with a robust sense of humor will enjoy it; and hordes of easily offended viewers will fume with outrage. But since half the dialogue was in Bulgarian; I thought I might shed some light on just how great and funny Maria Bakalova's performance was in this film. First; let start off with how difficult this was to film. There are many wild and provocative scenes; Rudy Giuliani's "bed scene" chief among them; that were an absolute feat to pull off. Everything was wrapped in a funny; surreal story about Premier Nazarbaev using Borat as a spy on American soil; and Borat reconnecting with his feral daughter whom he uses as a honey trap against US politicians.Hiding cameras in plain sight and nudging people to reach the limits of their own insanity is what Sacha Baron Cohen does best; and is a testament to his brilliance. He challenges conservative prudishness by flashing a mirror in front of it; and the result in outrageous; provocative and awakening.Going back to Maria Bakalova; she was the best support Sacha could have asked for in this movie. Her transformation from a crude feral child to a Westernized and emancipated woman was as absurd as it was genuinely moving. Every single phase by her was likely a riff; or half-improv; but it added so much comedic value to the story. It surely sounded like gibberish to the broader audience; especially when mixed with Sacha Baron Cohen's "Kazakhstani". "You're a woman? Show me your p****!"; she demands of a bewildered caretaker who educates her about womanhood and self-respect. "Daddy! I swallowed the baby"; she says with childish panic before going to a clinic and pushing the nuances of planned Parenthood. This film creates unlikely protagonists and has several layers of thoughtfulness beneath the crude jokes and provocation. Comedic gems spoken in Bulgarian will remain hidden like Easter eggs throughout the movie; and I hope even fans of this film will re-watch it with curiosity to find them.
Finally; and most importantly; Borat 2 is not offensive to Kazakhstanis; who took the joke and used it as a clever tourism ad for their beautiful and spectacular country.As an Eastern-European; I am not offended either. I hope Westerners will be just as robust in their humor and self-mockery.
Enjoy this film for what it is; and for the crazy time when was filmed. If you are still hesitating about seeing it; trust me; "pochti niama da sajaliavate :)"...,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6215329/?ref_=tt_urv
 Looked fake!,1,472,970,efecctor,23 October 2020,All throughout the movie I couldn't help but notice that most of the pranks are fake and unreal. I mean is there a single person in America that doesn't recognize sacha baron cohen; even with tons of beard and hair and all that makeup. Screw republicans and democrats; screw trump and biden; screw politics; borat used to be a genuine comedy full of incredible extreme pranks ; but now it looks like a political garbage desperately trying to deliver a propaganda.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198983/?ref_=tt_urv
 I'm a huge fan but this wasn't funny.,5,280,565,rphanley,23 October 2020,I really was excited for this movie but it didn't deliver at all. It felt extremely rushed and the comedy wasn't there. I laughed once during the entire movie. It's obvious they had a deadline and pushed this out to meet it. This was a huge bummer. I wanted Borat not this.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198720/?ref_=tt_urv
 Maria Bakalova, a star is born,8,88,166,ChaCha44,26 October 2020,Don't see this if you don't want to be entertained or experience cringe worthy moments but especially don't see this if you don't want to see a true breakout star in the hysterical and lovely; Maria Bakalova who reminds me of a young Tracy Ullman. She is amazing.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208543/?ref_=tt_urv
 An amazing sequel, slightly better than the original movie.,8,10,14,fciocca,3 November 2020,Borat is back after more than 10 years since his original installment in 2006; and oh boy if it was funny. I think that this sequel was actually slightly better than the original movie; for sure I laughed more and I really appreciated Tutar; the daughter of Borat portrayed by Maria Bakalova. She was amazing and I genuinely think that she had the most funny jokes this time; her character has a progressive and interesting development. There is a special chemistry between the two main characters and I really like how their daughter-father relationship evolves. Both actors speak their native languages; Sacha I presume communicates in Yiddish; while Tutar I am sure speaks Bulgarian. It shouldn't be easy to coordinate during dialogues when you use two completely different languages; so good job.Compared to the previous movie; I think that almost every scene was prepared in advance. The first movie on some points looks more spontaneous and have this documentary-vibe; while in Borat 2 is heavily scripted and you lose in fact that mockumentary feeling. A different approach to the script that I have personally appreciated. The movie is very actual; they managed to speak a little bit about the global pandemic and to make fun of conspiracy theories. Cohen is known for his controversial humor and he managed to joke about the current political; economical and social current situation in America.Borat is a political movie; but manages to be light-hearted and entertaining; I passed 90 amazing minutes by laughing and enjoying this sequel. The plot is simple and effective. Watch it if you want to have a funny evening; even better if you invite friends at home to watch it together; you will have really good time.The sequel is actually slightly better than the original movie,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6232769/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious! Every bad review is from Trumps right wingers!,9,70,130,Freakazoid13,31 October 2020,Borat 2 is just as funny as the first one. I missed half the movie because I was laughing so hard so I had to watch it again! 99% of these negative reviews are from Trumpers who hate anything that goes against their leader! They hate Hollywood; the left; or anyone else that tells the truth about their POS leader! If you want to laugh as hard as you have in a long time then go watch this movie!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6220625/?ref_=tt_urv
 I'm just here for all of the triggered Trump supporters,8,55,100,nyccma1974,31 October 2020,If people think this is left-wing propaganda and the first Borat film didn't poke fun at the right; clearly is not very observant! Borat was never for you; so stop with the faux outrage!This was hilarious. Not as good as the first but still hilarious. The scene in the clinic was all kinds of hysterical and cringy combined. The actress who played his daughter stole the show this timeVery nice...high five!!!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6221463/?ref_=tt_urv
 Maria Bakalova kills it.,8,74,139,yamxt600,24 October 2020,The movie is fun; offensive; occasionally not for weak stomachs and obviously legendary already for the Giuliani bit.
But Maria Bakalova as Borats daughter really kills it and I truly hope this opens the doors for her for a full fledged Hollywood career. I'll keep my fingers crossed.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203519/?ref_=tt_urv
 Brilliant!!,10,241,489,bucky716,23 October 2020,Brilliant and full of laughs within the first 10 minutes that continue. This has Borat in the title but Tutar Sagdiyev aka the daughter of Borat aka real name Maria Bakalova is a new star.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197679/?ref_=tt_urv
 Freaking Hilarious!,9,214,432,robscott-1313,23 October 2020,Borat 2 is an absolutely hilarious movie. The first one was so funny I thought there would be a let down but I was dead wrong because this was almost just as good.

 Borat 2 Subsequent Moviefilm,9,11,16,rnixon-15663,6 November 2020,Borat A subsequent movie film
2020
15
Director: Jason Woliner
Starring: Sacha Baron Cohen; Maria Bakalova etcOverall rating 91/100Borat the subsequent moviefilm sees the return of Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) who must return to America in order to sell his daughter to powerful American politicians but he grows a connection with her. Well what can I say Borat 2 was bonkers and insane; but mostly brilliant; clever and had a lot more heart than the first film; so let's get started.First of all the movie was very funny; had great comedic performances and chemistry as well as a fun set up. This movie was absolutely hilarious; even more outrageously funny than the first film; there was so many funny comedy skits; highlighting and cleverly taking the mick out of a lot of republicans and how they have handled many things; it's humour was even more clever; and due to everything that's going on right now gave even more comedic opportunities and satire for Borat to be involved with. The comedic performance from Sacha Baron Cohen was also as expected fantastic; he bought the character of Borat back to life perfectly with fantastic dialogue and his form of comedy and his comedic timing was excellent here; but also Maria Bakalova was fantastic here as well; she held her own with Sacha and in some places was even more funny than him; they both had excellent chemistry with each other and watching there relationship develop was great. The set up for the movie was also very fun; having the view of Kazakhstan being the complete opposite and Borat being forced out of the country set up the main plot point and new characters well; and was a creative way to develop the story.My only negative for the movie would be that they went slightly too far with some of the comedy. I did feel like the movie went slightly over the line with certain skits and costumes that felt more offensive than funny for me in places; the movie usually does a great job at being controversial but still able to get away with it; but I definitely think they went slightly too far in a couple of places.My final few positives would be the themes; links to real people; costumes and heartwarming moments. The movie had really great themes of really showing you how extreme and horrible a lot of Trump supporters opinions are and was a shocking but needed insight into the political divide in America; the links to real life people like Melania Trump or the random name drops and cameos for comedic effect were excellent and cleverly executed. The costume designs for Borat were also excellent and funny; due to the success of the first film Sacha was being recognised more by the public; so hats off to the costume team for providing very convincing and often hilarious costumes for Borat to wear. Finally the movie had a lot more heartwarming moments than the first film; the themes of women being capable of anything and that everyone is human and not so different was handled really well; with some genuinely kind and caring people involved within the film that was very sweet to watch.Overall Borat 2 a subsequent movie film; despite going slightly too far in places; is just as clever; outrageous and hilarious as the first film with a great new member of the cast and more heart than the first film.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6241677/?ref_=tt_urv
 Trump supporters are giving it 1 out of 10!,10,17,27,Wittercom,7 November 2020,Amazing; Sacha remains a genius.Fantastic work.As with all his work it's amazing. He always uncovers such gross and frightening attitudes and opinions.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6243309/?ref_=tt_urv
 Vulgar, disappointing and not funny,1,290,604,internet-52971,23 October 2020,I'be been a fan of SBC since he was Ali G on UK TV. Back then his comedy was a breath of fresh air. The first Borat film was hilarious as was Grimsby. But this effort fell flat and the dull story couldn't be revived by the extreme vulgarity in the story. I don't think I laughed more than a couple of times. Final verdict: terrible.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199467/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not Nearly As Funny as 1st,1,339,711,stosh-96135,23 October 2020,One or two raunchy laughs. Nothing special. Cannot even be compared to first film. The movie is about 90 minutes long; and 75 of it is somewhat boring.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198823/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat lost his way,3,315,660,juanquaglia,23 October 2020,I was a huge fan of Sacha Baron Cohen until this point. I enjoyed Borat; Bruno and Who is America? a lot; and I considered him one of the greatest American comedians. But what he has done here left me deeply disappointed and even angry.
Borat Subsequent Moviefilm has a couple of great moments; but most of the film is scripted; with few real situations. So overall the film is less enjoyable than the previous one. It is understandable; though. Probably Borat's job is a bit more difficult now that he is recognised everywhere; so I imagine it's quite difficult to find unsuspecting victims.
It is also understandable that real scenes are edited in a way to make them look funnier than they really are. The Pence rally we saw in the trailer seemed very funny; but when checking raw filming from people who were actually there we soon realise nothing happened the way it's been shown. Again; I understand it's part of making a movie.
What I can't forgive is dishonest editing. The famous Rudy Giuliani scene that appeared everywhere as a news story and is supposed to be the highlight of the film is probably the most dishonest and misleading piece of cinematic narration I've ever watched. The editing goes crazy there; with several fragments that last 3 seconds. I'd love to see the raw material from that scene; because I have no doubts it has been presented in a very insidious way.
The other source of disappointment is that overall it seemed like an anti-Trump film more than a Borat film. The propaganda seems to take over the comedy. The timing of the release; so close to the election; also contributes to this interpretation.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198727/?ref_=tt_urv
 Great movie, awesome humor, with like usual easy targets to play with.,9,12,18,deloudelouvain,5 November 2020,I'm amazed by the pretty high score the movie gets. 6.9 isn't bad at all; as I was expecting Republicans being all over this trying to keep the score down. I guess at one point they just don't want to watch Borat's movies anymore as they just can't stand how ridicule they look. You can say it's all fake; which it isn't by the way; apart from one scene or two; but the truth is just that it's very easy to find Republicans to make fun of; they're just an easy target as their ideas and beliefs are just so dumb you would be a fool to not take advantage of that. Sacha Baron Cohen understands that like no other and proves it again with his second Borat movie. I loved the first one and I loved this one. It might be shocking to some but does it really matter when it's that funny? It shows some perverted Republicans like Giuliani; he can deny whatever he wants but the images speak for themselves. Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat is this time assisted by his daughter played by Maria Bakalova; both did a great job playing those characters. I guess his next mission will be making a third Borat movie; which will be difficult to fool those Republicans again; or is it that difficult to fool idiots?,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6237313/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious and courageous!,9,12,18,rogiervanwegberg,4 November 2020,Borat and his 'daughter' are fantastic!

 I freaking love it!,10,13,20,cathiyx,5 November 2020,Even it has loads of more or less light triggers I laughed way too often and I don't regret it at all! Loved the first movie and the whole idea behind a soft scripted movie with a lot of improvisations and also dancer for Sacha Baron Cohen and the crew! Amazing what he's doing just for make the audience laugh and tell his point of few.
Waiting for the next one ;),https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6236624/?ref_=tt_urv

 Better Than "Cultural Learnings for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan",8,9,13,PyroSikTh,4 November 2020,Subsequent Moviefilm follows the same basic premise as the first movie; Sacha Baron Cohen dresses up as an outlandish character and travels across America pranking real American citizens; and revealing the true nature of normal people; from the good to the bad. This time however; instead of chasing after Pamela Anderson; Borat has his daughter with him; and hopes to marry her off to one of Trump's political allies in order to earn a better reputation for glorious nation of Kazakhstan. This results in a much more interesting and engaging story; and gives us another character to get to know and really root for. Azamat; the producer in the first movie; was never given much attention as a character. He was just someone for Borat to feed off of. But Tutar is not treated the same way; and even has her own character arc and her own chances to prank people. Not to mention the twists and turns brought on by current events that were moulded into the story so effortlessly it's hard to believe they started filming this last year before everything hit the fan. Not only is the pandemic slotted in so seamlessly; but it manages to elevate the movie - from a narrative standpoint - far above anything else Baron Cohen has done.Of course Borat is all about the pranks; and while the tighter narrative of the movie does make the whole affair feel a lot more scripted; it's no less funnier for it (in fact it might debatably be funnier; but we'll get there in a minute). Definite highlights include Tutar's time with the Jeanise; the babysitter; who thought she was participating in a real documentary about teenage brides. What she puts up with from newcomer Maria Bakalova is astounding; and she comes across as the most effortlessly caring and wholesome person; doing what she can to change Tutar's worldview. She's also low-key hilarious by herself; such as her reaction to Tutar calling the Earth flat; or the way she points out that breast implants are not going to change much in Tutar's life. Another entirely wholesome highlight is Borat's 5-day stay with a couple of redneck guys who; while clearly misinformed themselves; do all they can to educate Borat. These are guys who think Coronavirus is fake; and avoid liberal people as much as they can; and yet they take a complete stranger into their home when he had nowhere to stay (at least to their knowledge); and offer assistance however they can. Baron Cohen dressed as Trump bursting in on a speech by Mike Pence; the constant back-and-forth with a poor postman and his fax machine; and the pair going to a pro-life health centre to remove a candy baby from Tutar are hilarious as well; while the Women's Club and Debutante scenes are prime cuts of cringe and embarrassment.Between all of that and the more traditional comedy moments between Borat and Tutar; I would argue Subsequent Movefilm is a far funnier movie than the first Borat. The first had its moments for sure; but Subsequent Moviefilm is almost relentless with its jokes. It not only aims higher; but hits higher as well. The more obviously scripted nature of the film is bound to turn off some die-hard fans; but for me it meant the jokes were really worked on and refined in order to be as funny as they could possibly be. The best example of this is the Disney-parody of Melania Trump; and her first meeting with Trump; all in Disney-style cartoon. And then was the song Borat performs really written by the rednecks? I doubt it; it has Baron Cohen all over it. But that didn't make his performance of it at the anti-mask rally any less hilarious to watch.
But of course being a Borat movie; there's more here than just the comedy. Beneath the jokes and pranks is more of a look at the highs and lows of American society. I've already mentioned how wholesome both the black babysitter and the rednecks were despite their political viewpoints; but it swings the other way as well. The pastor at the women's health centre barely bats an eye at the implication that Borat impregnated his daughter; and in light of those revelations; still refuses Tutar's right to an abortion. Not to mention the numerous occasions of unashamed creeps like the plastic surgeon who admits he would take advantage of Tutar was Borat not present; or Guiliani himself who did not come off in a particularly great light even before the moment of controversy. Then there's the frightening situations of mob mentality Borat encounters; such as his prank on Mike Pence being met with the crowd chanting "four more years"; or his racist; misogynistic; and anti-Semitic song being welcomed and cheered on by a crowd of anti-maskers. Baron Cohen said himself that he was forced to wear a bulletproof vest on a couple of occasions; something he was never required to do for the first film.Some of this movie will not age well; most notably anything relating to coronavirus (which ended up being nearly half the movie); while other moments (again coronavirus related) have aged like a fine wine already. Baron Cohen appears so much more at home in the character of Borat than he ever was in the first movie; resulting in his pranks being so much more effective; as well his general acting making the whole affair a lot more convincing. Unfortunately for him; he discovered Maria Bakalova who is astonishing and gives it her all. There was not a single moment she wasted; and she committed one hundred percent to every gag and every prank; not only keeping up with Baron Cohen; but sometimes completely blowing him out of the water. Some people will hate the increased sense of script; while I feel the movie benefited greatly from it; and it's still chock full of candid improv moments to keep it as Borat as always. I enjoyed this a lot more than the first movie; like it's not even close. I could definitely see myself watching this again in the near future. I give it a very high 8/10 (so high I genuinely debated giving it a 9).,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6236113/?ref_=tt_urv
 Can't be compared with the previous ones,3,283,612,Hazu29,23 October 2020,It's just bad; 98% it's all scripted and staged and the daughter's scenes are not funny.
The old Borat would have epic non staged scenes and he would make fun of anyone; doesn't matter their political side; race or gender. In 2020 we would expect Borat to crash rallies; parades and cupcakes student councils. But nothing... Just staged unfunny stuff and same jokes all over again. Very disappointed. Just watch the old movies. This one is super boring.Basically he just played it safe. He's afraid to be canceled so he just went after people that don't go crazy on Twitter. Old Borat (and Bruno or Ali G) would never be afraid of being canceled.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198020/?ref_=tt_urv
 What is the point?,1,270,583,JayTeamman,23 October 2020,The main appeal of part one was being able to observe the culture clash during the confrontations with real people out there in the wild. This one replaced all of that with cringe-worthy; Reality TV level fake BS. And the grand finale/scandal is clever editing and shameful practices at best; entrapment and defamation at worst. Most of the jokes and social commentary contained feel like someone rushed to harvest the lowest hanging fruit and turned them into an easily digested; yet nutritionally completely void sludge for the lowest common denominator audience. Strange to see from such a seemingly intelligent guy.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199911/?ref_=tt_urv
 Seemed mean-spirited at times,4,170,360,kr98664,25 October 2020,Don't get me wrong. I laughed myself silly quite a few times. But the tone of this sequel seemed off; and it took a while to realize the difference.In the original; Borat played such a complex; naive character; a true fish out of water. If you had encountered such a person in real life; you'd wholeheartedly want to help him. And that's where the original's hijinks started.Subtle character differences in this one; though. The seemingly sweet veneer was gone at times. Rather than having some more or less harmless fun with the unknowing participants; he struck a harsher mocking tone. Several scenes are rather cringeworthy. Some kind; decent people bent over backwards to help a guy in a bad spot; and caught nothing but crap for their efforts. I'd call that a big misfire; and it severely detracted from any desired comedic tone.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204333/?ref_=tt_urv
 Cohen is a genius...and Borat 2!,10,47,90,lisamicklewright,27 October 2020,It is wonderfully refreshing how Cohen exposes American society to us in this extraordinary year; 2020; with the covid pandemic in full swing. The election result will reveal itself in the next few days and when you see the people filmed In Borat Subsequent Moviefilm you really do fear for the result!
Borat and his daughter Tutar; played brilliantly by Bulgarian actor; Maria Baklova; travel around the US and I ached with laughter watching them.....especially during the Blood Moon Dance...it was a brilliant v's up at a ridiculous way of life that still seems to persist. The willingness of the fax machine man and Bakery lady to just "do their job"; the people at their meetings and conventions; who seem unaware of a world outside their airless bubble.....yes the world is frighteningly flat here. A lifeline of hope was the black babysitter.....who's clarity changed the films direction beautifully. Cohen always addresses anti-semitism and again the synagogue visit eloquently did the job. I also like the fact that fluent Hebrew is used as Kazak(I think) The Guilliani scene is just icing on the baby cake. Thank you Mr Cohen; many a truth said in jest!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6210575/?ref_=tt_urv
 Great Success! It Trumps the Original,10,145,305,TheAll-SeeingI,23 October 2020,Arriving with the urgency of a crossroads election or critical vaccine; the eviscerating "Borat Subsequent Moviefilm" calls satire from its culture-cancelled tomb; as Sacha Baron Cohen's iconic Kazakhstani journalist returns to drop the pants on America's mutated lunacies.A timely underlying story catapults "Borat Subsequent Moviefilm" past its legendary predecessor. Having shamed Kazakhstan; Borat is directed to fly stateside and regain America's goodwill; this will be done by gifting a monkey to Vice President Mike Pence. But the little one doesn't make it; as it's eaten by Borat's stowaway teen daughter Tutar - an extraordinary Maria Bakalova - whom Borat decides must supplant the monkey as the bribe offering to Pence. Clever character arcs and unforeseen father-daughter tenderness catalyze the absurdity of a plastic surgeon breaking down the constructs of a Jewish nose; while a smug; early-2020 Pence announces that his country that cages Mexican kids has contained its coronavirus count at 15.While sticking its blade beneath our ribs; the revelatory "Borat Subsequent Moviefilm" morphs our unfunniest bunglings into something sharply hilarious. - (Was this review of use? If so; let me know by clicking "Helpful." Cheers!) - WATCHED IT? THEN WATCHLIST: "Blazing Saddles (1974);" "Stadium Anthems (2018);" "Sausage Party (2016).",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197670/?ref_=tt_urv
 Garbage,1,98,201,aponteh,24 October 2020,This movie is extremely stupid and not funny at all; the first one was better. Don't waste your time,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202704/?ref_=tt_urv
 So obvious this film has been rushed out for the election,3,163,346,amnsulh,25 October 2020,The original film was superb but this sequel is predictable; poorly written and just plain boring. Let me just put out there now that I'm no fan of Trump and my opinion is by no means biased. However the film tries too hard to smear conservatives and it just ends up looking desperate and unfunny.
Furthermore the sense of deja vu is overwhelming as SBC recycled far too much from the original and it just does not work in 2020. Introducing a significantly new character is often a sign of desperation and the introduction of Borat's daughter Tutar is no exception. She's like Scrappy doo in Scooby doo or the sand snakes in Game of thrones. Tutar is another awful character but I understand why she was necessary as Borat is too well known in 2020 to trick people into an interview. It begs the question was this film necessary? I would say definitely not. For me it has soured the Borat character and taken some shine from the original film. SBC is a genius but I can only imagine that he was forced into making this film for political reasons.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206465/?ref_=tt_urv
 Just rubbish,1,224,485,olliebenet,23 October 2020,I'm European and as anti Trump as you can be; but it's just not very good; it's some silly acting with about 3 poor; unimportant pranks around potty humor. It's not even as extreme as most of the news that comes out of the US; or Q Anon and other clowns on Facebook. If you want awkward; funny pranks that make you laugh; Impractical Jokers is funny; but this? This is just people watching someone be ridiculous; they don't even interact this time round...,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199640/?ref_=tt_urv
 Tired and repetitive.,1,84,171,henrybrown-terry,25 October 2020,Tired and repetitive.
The Borat character was mildly amusing in the first film. For about half an hour. There was nothing there that was even remotely funny and this second film reinforces that.
I am so reminded of the meerkats in the TV ads (they are unfunny and irritating also).
This bloke has turned a ten minute sketch into a very unfunny career. A bit like Steve Coogan.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203958/?ref_=tt_urv
 A complete waste of your time,1,73,147,sheedykieran,24 October 2020,Not funny; not smart; a lampooning designed to appeal to the halfwitted.

 So sad to see Borat's end. Please save Bruno,1,179,384,garybest-57435,23 October 2020,This was unwatchable. I made it 37 minutes and realised it was utter garbage. Not funny at all. Not even tongue in cheek funny. Not even kindly amusing. Just tired. Very tired.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199469/?ref_=tt_urv
 What a piece of Cra$,1,52,102,prolead,24 October 2020,Just for the record; I'm not from the US. I expected the movie to be Anti Trump but this is a waste of time and not funny by a mile.

 A big disappointment,1,45,87,gurbuzfam,25 October 2020,Disappointed.after the first movie. Fake and disgusting from beginning to the end. I know you're going to watch it regardless; at least know that you'll be watching a third class movie.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204206/?ref_=tt_urv
 you've seen the advert for the movie - you have seen all funny parts...,1,143,305,filipmail,23 October 2020,It's not funny; humour for people intellectually impaired; Coen is out of his tricks; terrible; offensive and simply stupid...better have a nap then watch Coehn turd... utterly disgusting; low level humor; avoid...how this get 7 starts?? go figure,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199487/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat Jumps The Shark,1,157,337,dougmacdonaldburr,23 October 2020,This is bad. I used to like Sacha Baron Cohen; but; not anymore. All he ever does is dress up like some weird character and pretend to be dumb in the hope of tricking people into saying embarrassing things. What I really hate is that a lot of the people he tricks are just being nice and even trying to help him; but; he tries to frame it in such a way that they look like bad people. It is all just so his clique of liberal cosmopolitan elites can look down on Muslims and Christians. I will admit that Cohen is smart and capable of being funny; but; he is not as smart or funny as he thinks he is. I watched this with my family (who loved the first movie) and they did not laugh once during this film. It is all basically the same formula and really forced. I imagine this will get quite good reviews because he attacks Trump and most critics will love that; but; this is not a good movie. There really isn't anything that was not already covered in the first movie. They did not need to make a sequel; it is really bad and a complete waste of time and money. Borat has officially jumped the shark.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199893/?ref_=tt_urv
 Pseudo-subversive woke agitprop,1,37,70,reedraymondb,25 October 2020,Sacha Baron Cohen could have easily (and should have) created something worth placing alongside his previous work here by clowning both sides of the political aisle. To have done so might have been a much needed transcendence
of the hyper-politicized atmosphere suffocating pretty much everything these days.Instead; he offers more of the same stale and thinly veiled leftist propaganda masquerading as comedy we can already find almost everywhere; somewhat akin to an R-rated Jimmy Kimmel.... yawn.At what point did this once brilliant artist cease being brave?Also; unlike his previous films; most everything in this is obviously staged with everyone on camera in on the joke; making it even less funny.Granted; Maria Bakalova added a lot to the film and there were one or two genuinely funny scenes. However; this was overall very disappointing compared to his previous work and I'll likely skip Cohen's next; as he has apparently foregone true comedy for banal political activism.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206215/?ref_=tt_urv
 Same old,2,188,408,mikeygirwin,23 October 2020,Pretty much same old clichés. No longer funny. He's a clever guy and has done some very good stuff but this is schoolboy humour. Very disappointing,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198724/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hil-friggin-larious!!,10,11,17,niseynisey,7 November 2020,I never saw the original movie. It just didn't appeal to me. I ended up wanting to watch another comedy tonight so I threw this one on. I've never laughed so much. This movie was HILARIOUS to me! Call me immature; today; on my 39th birthday; but I found this humor wonderfully crude; politically incorrect; and a breathe of fresh air. I also loved the "real world scenes". Did he actually get these people to believe he was who he said he was??? That was amazing. I need an explanation. To Google I go lol.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6241829/?ref_=tt_urv

 Pure political garbage,1,76,155,ejedrysek,25 October 2020,The first film was genuinely funny. This round; released on the eve of the last debate and a week before the election; is entirely motivated as a political party smear.

 Not funny,1,60,120,jakesteinberg-17396,25 October 2020,Not funny like the first one. It must be because it had a purely political motive rather than a comedic motive.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206552/?ref_=tt_urv
 Its just Cringe,1,131,279,vojtaturon,23 October 2020,First Borat movie is so much better and actually funny. This is just cringey mess with unfunny;forced daughter who just shouting nosenses whole time and thinks its funny. Which made whole movie unwatchable for me.

 Borat 2 ...,8,25,45,jameswentland,31 October 2020,I mean if you didn't like the comedy and rudeness of borat you will definitely not appreciate the comedy of this film either as it is 100 times ruder than the original beside from that it was a perfect sequel to a very creative and funny film the acting was brilliant and borat managed to yet again achieve his goal of once again showing people's real ideas,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6222115/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not as good as the first but still great watch,8,35,66,djanimartinov,29 October 2020,We cant expect it to be as crude and funny as before sadly thanks to cancel culture but borat still pushes boundries . Entertaining for sure.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6216938/?ref_=tt_urv

 It's time for Borat to grow up,1,35,66,minxxy-36849,25 October 2020,Like many of the people who have commented on here; I have enjoyed Cohen's previous work... but this is frankly appalling and I am not sure what film the people who have this anything over a 5 have been watching as it certainly wasn't the same one that I watched.Ok; the film is trying to expose the ridiculous politics and clash of cultures; but what really stuck out to me was a complete lack of respect for those who have lost people to COVID; or have suffered sexual abuse from Hollywood stars. These are all fairly raw subjects and I see no reason why this film needed to be released now. Why would amazon put money into this disgusting display is beyond me.Aside from the topical faux pas; this is the same old jokes and the same old gig of getting abhorrent people to get in to situations which make them look ridiculous; which; ok; can be amusing at times; but just watching this just left me feeling annoyed rather than the piece of escapism I was hoping for.Cohen has lost his way and probably should settle back for a life off camera now as the 90s is over and the world is moving in from childish satire.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206388/?ref_=tt_urv
 Political all around,1,35,66,riley1709,24 October 2020,Nothing quite like trying to escape politics and watch some entertainment only to have it shoved down my throat in Borat 2. Loved Borat 1 but #2 was an obvious political tool that sort of ruined the series. Now I'm not a conservative but it would have been nice for the movie to follow the entertainment style that it provided in its last movie without diving into politics and current events. Entertainment is meant to escape from what's going on currently; not to immerse ourselves in political manipulation.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201198/?ref_=tt_urv
 An hour and a half long political commercial,1,54,107,dkenific,25 October 2020,One star; basically an hour and a half long political commercial.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204354/?ref_=tt_urv
 Balkan culture: not worthy of mockery (ignorant appropriation),1,42,81,kada-61986,25 October 2020,There are certain themes that the movie mocks openly and none of these are to blame for my disappointment. The Balkan culture appears in the movie on a few occasions and it seems that it is not even significant enough to be mocked at; but rather to be ignorantly used and appropriated.Starting with "Ederlezi"; a song ingrained in Balkan traditions and usually associated with celebrations that mark the beginning of Spring; it seems that it is thrown in the opening scenes of the movie without any apparent reference to Balkan values or traditions.The second and main ignorant reference to the Balkan culture is the character portraying Borat's daughter. Throughout the whole movie; she is speaking in Bulgarian which is presented as Kazakh or Russian (not clear what their intentions were); and Borat seems to be replying mainly with some animal sounds. It would be understandable if a leitmotif in the story was the view of English-speaking countries on foreign languages; but from what I've gathered the insolent use of a language completely unrelated to the story did not seem worthy of mockery.With this movie; Sacha just shows a stand of a conformist who is only capable of joking with comfortable themes which in today's context are some really low hanging fruits.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205917/?ref_=tt_urv
 It's junk, fake reviews?,1,91,189,saidintime,23 October 2020,In the shadow of the first film totally lacking the light-hearted energy and comedy gold of the original.All the same set ups as the old one but it all seems so dull; the energy isn't there; and there is nothing new to pull it along.It becomes tired early on and relies on the Rudy Giuliani interview at the end to keep people holding onto the end; and then that's an even bigger let down.Glad I pay to see it in the cinema; COVID has it's perks.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198461/?ref_=tt_urv
 Woul give it 0 out of 10,1,86,178,lkolchin,23 October 2020,I loved the first Borat movie - it's a classic.

 First movies was good but this one is boring,1,34,64,dovla-79048,25 October 2020,It is clear that it is politically motivated which is a shame; therefore score is equivalent to that... I enjoyed Sascha while ago; where he never took any part and he mocked everyone equally; but this is a clearly movie targeting right wing voters and party with hidden agenda and releasing it one week before elections. Enough said... Sascha obviously lost his touch and/or he joined the leftist "train" just to keep his career rolling (like many of other hollywood actors).Really shame to see that.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205631/?ref_=tt_urv

 The Needed Evolution of Borat.. but with an Unfortunate (but Understandable) Lacking of Borat as Himself,8,52,103,ryan-beauchesne,24 October 2020,This was the needed evolution of Borat in the sense that it was much more story-focused with many scenes purely for plot over laughs; and a moral to the ending. Especially with a strong supporting actress (Totar was actually the star I believe); it was expectantly a slightly different feel and resultantly also less hilarious overall than the original; but still very funny and very enjoyable. I am glad they did it this way; though; for if they just made a shallow; meandering series of gags like the first film; it would have felt repetitive and lacking anything new. So; I think they did the right thing.The reason I give it 8 stars is that there is just something lost in not being able to see Borat in his original character form. Of course it is understandable and nothing can be done about it; but part of what makes Borat so funny is his facial expressions and goofy looks. This is sorely lost with all the disguises and costumes; and at moments you could even confuse yourself wondering if this is the new Borat movie or just another 'Who is America?' series..As usual; silliness and jokes aside; Borat works to expose the ignorance of people's belief systems; and especially that of far right-wing conservatives and Trumpism; tackling such critical current issues as the rise of conspiracy theories into mainstream populism; misinformation; misogyny; and more. The negative reviews here are clearly the Trumpists griping about being called out through this film. One reviewer even complained Borat should have been more 'fair' by equally attacking left-wing figures. Well; perhaps there's some truth in that there was a missed opportunity or two to poke a little fun at the Left; but let's be clear; Trumpism and the far-right is so far gone in the embodiment of moral corruption and anti-intellectualism; it deserves all the criticism and ridicule it gets.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202380/?ref_=tt_urv
 Ponderous and Boring.,1,33,62,russell-14896,25 October 2020,Don't waste your time. Not funny like the original. Weak attempt to belittle conservatives.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204023/?ref_=tt_urv
 A terrible film.,1,33,62,markygrosvenor,24 October 2020,A dreadful film full of desperate cheap laughs; it may have worked 13 years ago with the original but the format hasn't aged well.
Was tough to even finish; don't think I laughed or smiled at all throughout.Very disappointed.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202823/?ref_=tt_urv
 Miserable and Desperate,1,57,114,draper_t,23 October 2020,This movie made every attempt to be funny; while being witty; and it was neither. It was painful to watch. Sacha Baron Cohen takes every possible liberal talking point and tries to make fun of conservative views.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199871/?ref_=tt_urv
 Been there, seen that....,2,21,37,inkedbydesigninc,25 October 2020,This movie is even better than the first one............NOT!! Now that we all know the premise; after watching the first movie; the jokes all seem old and recycled. The first movie was funny because we loved watching people's honest reaction to what they thought was a real documentary.Now; everyone is in on the joke so the jokes seem forced and not quite as "real". Having his daughter added to the mix just seemed like a desperate attempt to even get the movie made; as every knew who the Borat character really was; as shown in the beginning of the movie - with fans & autograph seekers wanting selfies taken with him.If you liked the first movie; like I did; I think you'll be disappointed with this one.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204755/?ref_=tt_urv
 Boring and not funny,1,51,101,imatrosov,25 October 2020,Big fan of Borat; loved the first movie but what did i just watch!Terrible; boring; not funny; scripted; lazy! I think thats the end of cohen as a legitimate satirical comedian. He really lost the magic and the content is just dumb.I would rate this -10 if i could; thats how lazy the script writing; acting; content was!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205641/?ref_=tt_urv
 A time waster nothing more,1,56,112,chipsesq,24 October 2020,Nothing like the first one;it raised a few giggles;but no laughs. Very politically biased;and obviously skewed in one direction. if you are fed up with this one sided bullying of people;and their voters;give this a strong pass;if you are of the type that is easilly manipulated by the likes of certain "news" organisations;and like to shout;or bark at people because you do not have a clear enough mentality to engage them in adult conversation;then you will love it. This "movie" is basically Baron Cohen in thick rimmed glasses;purple hair and a love Trumps hate placard in hand barking at the screen for ninety plus minutes.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201493/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious,10,32,60,Fixer-13257,28 October 2020,Hilarious. Some may not think this is as good as the others but it is still laugh out loud funny.If you are of the belief that some things are off limits; or some jokes "cross the line" - then you have no business watching Borat or Sacha Baron Cohens comedy.Borat comedy always goes for the low hanging fruit like religious fanatics and conservatives - as they make for good TV. This year just happened to have a lot to offer within arms reach. Cohen's over the top antics is a direct reflection of just how utterly ridiculous racism and sexism are in a world of seemingly intelligent people.Bulgarian actress Maria Bakalova steals the show; I don't know how she kept a straight face through filming any of her scenes.Hilarious; cringy; awkward; all things Borat.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6212460/?ref_=tt_urv
 So dumb,1,32,60,rcsembree,24 October 2020,One of the worst movie sequels I've ever seen. Totally played up on the gags of the original film and everything obviously scripted and staged. Cohen clearly was wanting a payday without having to create anything original.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200821/?ref_=tt_urv
 I am so glad this movie was made.,10,13,21,SomeoneDeBeauvoir,5 November 2020,It is fun; hilarious; the acting and improv is sound and commendable. It also offers a deeply troubling insight into what we are really willing to slide as our 'normal'.And I am writing this review while just being half way through it.
BUT OH MY GOD I COULD NOT WAIT TO WRITE THIS REVIEW BECAUSE IT IS ALL OF THE ABOVE AND IT IS OUTRAGEOUS. I LOVE IT SO MUCH. WOOHOOO.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6238232/?ref_=tt_urv
 "Very nice thank you very much",8,13,21,paudieconnolly,1 November 2020,A sequel often is a disappointment 14 years a is a long time of expectations to build. Brave and brilliant with a heart while still being an interesting look at the world we live in.super sequel,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6228154/?ref_=tt_urv
 Nowhere near in the same league as the first film,2,45,88,tracy-97320,23 October 2020,I watched the first film the night before this came out & 14 years later that is still god dam hilarious! Now unfortunately watching that one first & then this the following night; was a lot to live up to & this film just didn't..it felt like a crude dark attempt to make him relevant again; the originality of the first one wasn't there; the American politics bashing was a bit lame as it's like errr the rest are the world are gonna watch this & we don't care about your biased views & digs at politicians it's not funny to us; If anything it makes it less funny; more staged & quiet frankly a million miles away from the authenticity of the first. It really is a shame you couldn't just leave it at that one film gem.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199978/?ref_=tt_urv

 Woke Hollywood stikes again,1,55,110,myemail-42195,24 October 2020,Such a shame; I absolutely loved the first film. The character of Borat has been weaponized by the left wing propaganda machine. A lot of these "people" who didn't know who he was were obviously actors. I'm all for poking fun at the right; but this film was completely biased in one direction and made zero jokes and held no one accountable on the left. You guys should have just stuck to spoofing people instead of the "orange man bad" default crutch everyone falls back on when they run out of ideas. That is what made the original such a great film; little if any political agenda. This film just felt very lazy. The only time I felt like the old borat was back was during the father daughter dance scene; f@cking hilarious. Hollywood please stop preaching to your audience; and ruining modern cinema. Stick to creative and fun story telling. Leave politics out of my leisure time.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202357/?ref_=tt_urv
 turgid,1,64,130,charliegalloway,24 October 2020,Remember when Sasha Baron Cohen was inventive ; fearless ; original and above all very funny ; before he started wearing his woke heart on his sleeve ; this godawful film is as funny as a cry for help .
It is literally a gag an hour ; and they seem to have been written by Jason Manford ; Mike Read ; Jo Brand and Ted Rogers .
Makes Robin's Nest look like The Producers .,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201480/?ref_=tt_urv
 Low budget election campaign movie,2,44,86,p-angevare,25 October 2020,The second Borat movie is a huge disappointment. It is nothing more than a political statement that misses the humour and absurdity of the first movie.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205672/?ref_=tt_urv
 Absolute cringefest.,1,63,128,amaljon,24 October 2020,Doesn't serve much purpose besides reinforcing the 'Central Asians are uncivilised barbarians' stereotype and being a political propaganda tool to meddle with the American elections.
Kazakhstan deserves more than an apology; Sacha Baron Cohen and the Borat team owes the Kazakh folk reparations for the irreversible damage that this abomination had caused to the international reputation of the country.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203089/?ref_=tt_urv
 Its just not Funny - Total waste of time,1,37,71,taylorkaren-16284,25 October 2020,Sasha might have been funny once; but he's lost his edge; in fact I wouldn't even call this a comedy film; its more like a Russian Propaganda film; we didn't even make the end of the film; turned it off after 40 minutes. If anyone else is thinking about it; I wouldn't bother; in fact watching paint dry would be more entertaining ....,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205303/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not funny at all,1,37,71,kramermw,25 October 2020,I loved the first Borat movie but this second try is really a bomb. It's not funny at all.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205244/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not funny. Boring. Schematic.,1,37,71,mtrzesic,25 October 2020,Waste of time. Not funny and schematic. Offensive in a wrong way suppose to make it fresh but it did not. It is boring and predictable.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203968/?ref_=tt_urv
 Very poor, not funny at all,1,37,71,whiteigvc,24 October 2020,Not a patch on the original; I don't think I laughed at all. Very contrived and fake. Low budget; cheap,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202903/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not funny just liberal propaganda,1,43,84,petercarlsson-92297,25 October 2020,This is not a movie; but a try to make money of the first movie; and at the same time shoving leftish propaganda down the audiences throats. If you like that; you like that movie. If you like your comedies be... well... funny; this is a huge waste of time. But; sure; some people will off course be rich from this crap. But remember it's your money and your time you are giving them.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205690/?ref_=tt_urv

 Xenophobic Stereotyping Movie for Ethnocentrist Xenophobes,1,29,54,nstott,25 October 2020,Lame; monotonous; and childish middle school humor. Xenophobic stereotyping of another culture; so the xenophobic ethnocentrists are sure to love it. Waste of time at best.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203959/?ref_=tt_urv
 This isnt that good just Bad,1,42,82,setupastandard,25 October 2020,It doesnt work like it did in the first! Politics just garbage. I cant sit through more past 23 minute just uggg no!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204274/?ref_=tt_urv
 Horrible tasteless humor,1,36,69,pbgray-50495,25 October 2020,Horrible tasteless humor. I couldn't make it through the entire movie which contained juvenile humor and excruciating graphic display of female menstruation. Sasha Baron Cohen needs to find a new shtick! The only bright spot in this disaster of a movie is Maria Bakalova who should be a rising star if she can keep away from horrible productions such as this!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206054/?ref_=tt_urv
 Save your time!,1,36,69,alai002,25 October 2020,Probably a bad idea to watch before a dodger game but this was really bad. It's not like his previous work of comedy. Everything was flat; fake scenes; fake chop; audio misplacement. Was a borat fan for part 1 but this whole movie was a snooze fest,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204440/?ref_=tt_urv
 Pure junk,1,36,69,branka_stevanovic,24 October 2020,Amm; this is beyond bad; unwatchable. Wasn't a big fan of the first; but it was ok. This; just amazingly dismal.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202257/?ref_=tt_urv
 Nothing funny about it,1,162,355,SirCumference,23 October 2020,This was the most cringe-worthy rubbish to be touted as comedy I have ever watched. Puerile; toilet humour that did nothing make me smile once. Someone pad a lot of money to make this film; and to have an untalented lead to front it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199471/?ref_=tt_urv
 One star for each laugh,1,46,91,williamkelly-12810,25 October 2020,This movie was too scripted compared to the original Borat.Also period blood is not funny it's gross,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205491/?ref_=tt_urv
 Mind numbingly bad,1,98,208,danrudy-59340,24 October 2020,The original was something new and had funny moments.
This is like a comedian trying to make you laugh with the tenth retelling of a joke you already know. It's no longer funny. And once the humor is gone; we are just left with mean spirited scenarios trying to mock and belittle unsuspecting people. I found it incredibly boring. I think I broke a smile a few times but I hope this is the end of Borat. It's like Cohen is a one trick pony rehashing used setups. Time for something original.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200982/?ref_=tt_urv
 Had to turn it off,1,115,247,louis-47618,23 October 2020,I'm afraid I am only reviewing an hour as I turned this mess off.The original was a masterpiece; had me howling with laughter. This is absolute garbage; majority of it is scripted crap and the rest was poor.Nothing like the original please don't go into this movie thinking you are going to get the same as part one.Rubbish.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198671/?ref_=tt_urv
 It was just terrible ...spoiler alert..,1,27,50,alan-447-530129,25 October 2020,Spoiler alert - I am not a Trump supporterI really enjoyed the original Borat - it was clever; funny & impactful - this character in the original movie reminded me of the role of the court jester - to speak truth to power.This follow up movie was shockingly disturbing.I felt gross after watching it.Sacha Cohen crossed the line in multiple ways in his attempt to make his points.His points are true & valid.His approach with this movie was dark; disrespectful & disturbing.As the court jester; he has such incredible talent & a global platform.This was just awful.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203929/?ref_=tt_urv
 Very very disappointing,3,34,65,moritlh,25 October 2020,Unfortunately most of the jokes aren't funny and story is so boring,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206491/?ref_=tt_urv
 Seriously...,1,147,322,rajivkuin,23 October 2020,Movie is total garbage; nothing shocking or new... Just banking on profanity...Story is absolutely predictable which it should not be for a borat movie...,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198593/?ref_=tt_urv
 Forced jokes to make a political point,1,33,63,yewvibes,24 October 2020,Most of the jokes seem forced and designed to make a political point. The entire point of the movie is to paint mainstream Americans as dumb and worthless. The first one was actually funny; this one; not so much.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203046/?ref_=tt_urv
 Political propaganda from a Trump hater,1,73,152,eee-16089,24 October 2020,Loved the first one. Hate this one. Released before elections of course.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203105/?ref_=tt_urv
 Are you not tired of antiTrump comedy yet?,1,148,325,mortenklaebo,23 October 2020,Then this movie is perfect for you. This is old school pranksters; knocking inside open anti-Trump doors. Boring if you are tired of this.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198917/?ref_=tt_urv
 Total disappointment,1,61,125,gogga1011,24 October 2020,Loved it and laught first time; but this time... Cohen's jokes are very outdated and worn out; everything is based on old kindergarten-level jokes for morons and for perverts. Always the same deranged jokes about supposedly endangered Jews and gays and mocking republicans but he does not dare to criticize leftists; Antifa terrorists; BLM or their politicians. Very politically colored; biased to the far left. And this with Giuliani is the only thing that raised dust in this miserable piece of trash. But actually it is nothing interesting. It's all about Giuliani really adjusting his pants and microphones (the actress was helping him) and that was nothing indecent or shocking. And that's actually the whole plot of all this rubbish - how to cheat and mock Republicans and Conservatives. Utterly disaster for low IQ children. Cohen is not funny any more and it is time somebody to tell him that.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203043/?ref_=tt_urv
 Painfully unfunny,1,38,74,vanquish2020,24 October 2020,The 10 star reviews will likely be from the whiny; entitiled Democrats of the US and A with an IQ of about the same as a potato and even Canadians like myself know exactly which backwards States they're from. (cough California and New York),https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200590/?ref_=tt_urv
 Propaganda 2020,1,25,46,kovacsalbert,25 October 2020,I remember watching Borat as a teen when it first came out. The whole crowd in the cinema was laughing almost all the way threw the movie. It was new it was unbelievably funny and it was so original. If you have not watched the second part please do the original movie and yourself a huge favor and DONT watch it! It's basically an anti Trump movie right before the elections; but I don't get the point. Will anyone watch it and believe that it's not staged? The first movie was not that was clear but this? What's the point of the part when he goes in the synagogue dressed as a Jew when it is know that the the lady who are there already knew that this was a set up? Wasn't even funny. Who believes that the part when the three of them are in quarantine and come up with a song that he sings a day after is not staged? The whole movie seems fake and I can't remember one part that was actually funny. Too bad he did a second part ; I hope he does not ruin Bruno if Trump wins the election... The worst is the way they edited the whole movie ; just check how the real rally he attended happened... Do your self a favor; and don't watch it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205009/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat is not back,1,25,46,dinamoisamodinamo,25 October 2020,I don't even know where to start. Ali G was awesome; OG Borat was awesome; Dictator was OK and this is the worst movie I watched in a long time. It's like watching someone else trying to copy Borat and fails miserably. Maybe I had high expectations. Wouldn't recommend to anyone except die hard fans to who the name of the movie is enough.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203814/?ref_=tt_urv
 Personal attacks and scamming is not comedy.,1,106,228,nipple_blaster,23 October 2020,So they created a sex scandal with a prominent public figure. That is in no way comedy; it wasn't even in her character.While the first movie was great with its absurdity; the way they tried to outdo themselves in this one came out mostly infantile; as if it was fan fiction. But was entertaining at times and the segment with ballroom was hysterical and very masterfully done.It all fell apart when the interview came along. Tutar completely fell out of character when she started using her actual real-world charms and gestures (that rub on his knee) as a lead in to get him into that bedroom. If she was in actual character; she would have pulled her pants down and showed him her bloody bush right there during the actual interview; asking him to marry her. Really disgusting what they did there. Everyone is now preoccupied with analyzing how some guy put his hand in his pants after a gorgeous woman dragged him into a bedroom and went on to "remove his mic".,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198327/?ref_=tt_urv
 What a waste of time,4,96,205,malcolmjohnston,23 October 2020,Why why why?
For as funny as the original borax movie was this is a contrived mess
Bad editing to try and gain more impact
If you've never seen the original 2006 movie
Watch that instead of this utter rubbishA movie title that should have been one and done,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198938/?ref_=tt_urv
 Funny moments ruined by "real people",1,99,212,JonnyJohnsonIII,23 October 2020,I think the charm that borat was searching for was to display a hilariously offensive character in the world and political climate of 2020. They managed to create some pretty funny scenarios for Borats character to encounter with clever writing; and great improvisation from the actors. Where the film kind of fell apart for me; was that they were trying to portray many of the scenes as if they were raw reactions and takes with "real people". They had scenes in department stores; health clinics; and other every day locations. Although it becomes glaringly apparent that the people Borat talks to are actors; or at least playing a part. It gives the film a feeling of inauthenticity and detracts from what I believe they are trying to do. At times the film also blurs the lines between what is clever and funny; and what is just unsettling and gross. Given the timing of this film and the US elections; it feels uninspired and rushed. Entertaining at times; but falls flat,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197773/?ref_=tt_urv
 Lame,9,105,226,grantdog,23 October 2020,The first one was witty and funny. The second is just lame!!!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198692/?ref_=tt_urv
 All the negative reviews are from Trumpers... wonder why?,3,24,44,sarahdawson-44481,3 November 2020,I'd say at least 95% of the negative reviews are coming from Trumpers and the right. Wonder why that is? They go around spewing their hate in droves and hate anything that tells facts about their leader! They also hate anything with diversity. Click on one of their profiles and I guarantee you that all their negative reviews are about shows that have any diversity in it. I have and it's sickening. Just scroll down their reviews and they give any show that has a person of color; woman; gay person; etc a 1 or 2. They can't stand that the world is changing and for the better!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6231797/?ref_=tt_urv
 Tasteless and not very funny,2,24,44,csm-78119,25 October 2020,This is a poor offering. There are a few mildly funny bits but the casual racism and gross bottom of the barrel subject matter had me turning the thing off half way through. Trump and Trumpism are ripe for parody but there are a thousand better ways to do it than this; which feels like it's been written by a 12 year old boy who thinks he is being daring.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206076/?ref_=tt_urv
 An older, less funny Cohen with a political agenda,1,31,59,maligor5,24 October 2020,Yawn....if you're going to make a movie involving politics you at least need to poke fun at both sides (see the Hunt). Beyond that though; the humor Borat inspired worked because his character was so young and naive in the first one. With a much older Cohen; it's much harder to pull off this role and get the same laughs. This is just the norm; Jim Carey can no longer pull off his Dumb and Dumber character as we saw. Chevy Chase lost all his humor around 40-50. Cohen must be hard up for money to go back to the Borat well.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200541/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not a movie just propaganda.,1,41,81,RockChildRock,26 October 2020,Don't waste your time. Not even funny. Baron Cohen is just an activist; Jokes are political. If you are a liberal you will love it but if you are one of the common people you'll find it disgusting.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206822/?ref_=tt_urv
 Panders to the lowest common denominator.,1,95,204,fad-38798,23 October 2020,Very much the Emperors New Clothes here; this is not social nor political commentary.The subjects are not the smartest of people. He doesn't laugh with; he laughs at.What makes it worse; is Sascha Baron Cohen is a very competent actor; his turn in The Spy was excellent. And he spends his time making this?,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198398/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat No Make Much Funny Movie,1,75,158,lwmswm,26 October 2020,Borat no make much funny movie. It stink from many no fun liberal poke at people Borat not fit to lick boots. No like much this movie because it no make me laugh. Borat just confused liberal making stinky movie for other confused liberals.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206974/?ref_=tt_urv
 Rubish,10,67,140,sailorphil,24 October 2020,I actually enjoyed the first movie; but half way through this disaster of a movie; I just skipped ahead to see if it got better or even funny - I didn't laugh at all. The political agenda is blatant and honestly mean spirited; one sided and NOT FUNNY!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202394/?ref_=tt_urv
 Brilliant,4,120,263,argikon,23 October 2020,Another Cohen masterpiece.. it's obvious from the one star reviews that he was right on target.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198591/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat 2 is basically just a liberal political statement,5,86,184,andrewklocek,23 October 2020,The original Borat is the funniest movie I have seen. You could tell the interactions were genuine; and the movie didn't have a political agenda. Unfortunately Borat 2 is nothing more than a political statement with interactions that seemed scripted. It is basically just a long anti Trump commercial.The addition of his daughter really hurt the movie too. She was not funny; and her acting obviously ruined any potentially authentic reactions. The only funny parts in the movie were when it was just Borat.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198525/?ref_=tt_urv
 Utterly disappointing,1,62,129,neerajwandering,23 October 2020,This is a lame sequel to a great original. While the original is well researched with solid characters; the Borat in this one is a man who is lost between being authentic character he was; and just another normal guy.Laughs are forced; with the exception of a couple of places where it is the usual Sacha.
As a Sacha Baron Cohen fan; this was an utter disappointment.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199076/?ref_=tt_urv
 Anti Trump movie,2,61,127,muuun-04561,24 October 2020,Wow what did they do to borat?Its basically an anti trump propaganda movie.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202604/?ref_=tt_urv
 Sup,1,19,34,ivobg,26 October 2020,When I saw the trailer and the "forming scandal" with some politicians - I thought this will going to be a fun to watch movie; but it wasn't. Most of the jokes were too stupid even for Borat's level.As a Bulgarian myself - I'm still baffled why the daughter was speaking Bulgarian?! What was the point? Like.. No one would notice that or what?I know; I know - nothing makes sense with Borat movies. It seemed that there was scenes in the trailer which wasn't in the movie. Or it was just me who hasn't paying close attention? How could I.... it was very bad.I think that Borat's appearance at Jimmy Kimmel's show was five times funnier than this whole movie.My rating 2/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207387/?ref_=tt_urv
 Absolute waste of time,8,31,60,dheepak10,24 October 2020,The movie starts off well but anything that's funny about the movie takes place in the first 10 minutes.
After that the movie is just a bad editing of poorly planned scenes together.
The first movie was amazing but subsequent moviefilm reaches greater heights - Not!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202619/?ref_=tt_urv
 Screamingly funny,1,37,74,aphilipp,27 October 2020,I think you need to get Borat to see the funny side of this. The Americans are mesmerisingly obliging - no matter what they are asked to do and Borat and his daughter might as well be aliens. Hilarious.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6210224/?ref_=tt_urv
 Stupidest movie..,4,37,74,dennismillerinc,24 October 2020,Just such a waste of time.. not even funny; just cringe :/,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200444/?ref_=tt_urv
 I like Sacha Baron Cohen but he's way below his standards on this,2,14,24,griffidj,25 October 2020,The film seems rushed out and unfinished.I laughed for the first 8 minutes; silly voice; funny dialogue; odd Kazakhstan customs; then watched and cringed; and didn't laugh as the scripted set pieces rolled in.Possible spoilers; but i doubt it.....I don't get baby/doctor scene; why was this clever or funny; not explaining someone has swallowed a plastic toy and then expecting us to laugh at the poor doctor trying to help because he thinks the girls pregnant. The set up was poor and the joke was worse.Other scenes equally poor.Turned off after 56minutes.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206437/?ref_=tt_urv
 Lazy, biased and (most importantly) unfunny,1,78,169,dolemite72,23 October 2020,Although a fan of Borat (and to some extent; Sacha Baron Cohen) I went into this movie with the full knowledge that it was going to be a one-sided hit-piece on all things 'Trump'
At very least; I expected Baron Cohen to try pull 'something' (anything?) out of the bag; and make me laugh; despite myself......Sadly; not here.I'm fully aware; that Baron Cohen (and 'Borat' specifically) are quite well known to western audiences; so there's little anonymity to his 'schtick' this time around....but this movie still carried on as if it was all secretly filmed; on-the-hoof film-making (when it clearly wasn't)Everything here was staged (right down to briefest viginette) and all the (paid) actors and/or onlookers needn't have had to worry about 'corpsing' on camera....because the material here was (worryingly) dire. If this is the best they can do 'scripted'; then perhaps Baron Cohen needs to look elsewhere in future?Nothing (at all) rang true (not even the so-called 'shocked-reactions') This was a stale; lazy and predictable 'hit-piece' and (apart from chuckling slightly at the 'period-gag') the only 'funny' thing about it was the 'agenda' behind it.Amazon have put this out just before the election (and it shows) The finished product; could have (conceivably) been written; rehearsed; performed; filmed and edited over a wet weekend (it's simply *that* lacking and allround 'meh')Whereas Baron Cohen once used his 'stereotypical' (albeit; incestuous; fish-out-of-water) foreigner; to (cleverly) prank his prey into revealing their own (real) cultural prejudices/eccentricities....he instead targets the individual (Trump) .....and to a lazier extent; Conservatives and Christianity (primarily; because it's a lot safer than mocking the polar opposite; I guess?)
There was a minefield of material Baron Cohen could/should have used; had he kept it on a level-playing field. Which is a crying shame; because I could envision the (publicity-thirsty) Democrats actually being a lot more susceptible to pranks of this nature....but of course; actual comedy and entertainment take a backseat here; over political bias (and the public are sick to death of celebrity opinions as it is.....even moreso; when it's supposed to be a comedy)The (oh-so) 'controversial' Rudy Guiliaini sequence was about as forced and staged as everything else beforehand. Employing doubles; inserts and dubbing to pad out the flimsiest of scenes of the former Mayor lying down on a bed to remove his microphone pack.
I hope Guiliaini sues both Amazon and Baron Cohen....which would produce the one genuine laugh from this deeply; unfunny mess (Rounded off by sickening self-advertising from Amazon and a smug Tom Hanks cameo) that'll likely help cement Donald Trump another four years in office.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199693/?ref_=tt_urv
 Sacha is a parody of himself,10,36,72,thebogofeternalstench,24 October 2020,Straight away I noticed his Borat voice was so poorly done. Sacha's English accent kept slipping through and was just crap and off-putting. Lazy and rushed.This entire movie was a total $hit show from start to finish. Unfunny; pathetic stunts and pranks and unfunny dialogue. The period scene for example and saying to a doctor he put a baby inside his daughter....just not funny; and I'm no prudeIts a liberal propaganda film pathetically half disguised as a 'comedy' yet theres nothing funny in Borat 2.Borat 2 is worlds away from the very funny original Borat. I felt depressed as hell after watching Borat 2. Sacha is a sell out shill and only made Borat 2 as a smear campaign against Trump.Pathetic film making.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200963/?ref_=tt_urv

 Predictable but brilliantly executed and extremely funny!,3,26,50,sandykemp,27 October 2020,Borat is back with a vengeance! Yes it's more of the same sort of thing you'd expect but it still keeps you on the edge of your seat cringing (in a good way) throughout!The Rudy Giuliani scene is worth the wait. Believe me.I think Maria Bakalova has a bright future ahead of her as she seriously challenges Baron Cohen as to who is actually the funniest on this movie!I never thought we'd get a Borat sequel let alone one that actual managed to deliver.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6211512/?ref_=tt_urv
 Expectations hurt?,8,34,68,neilupinto,23 October 2020,I mean seriously the part one had genuinely funny moments and the whole concept itself made you wonder if it's actually a movie or something that really happened! It was crazy and spot on.
Part 2 tries HARD to get the same going but fails in almost every aspect! Even the jokes feel lame and not original.
If not for being bored; I don't think would have even bothered to finish off the movie.
Overall; you can easily skip this one with absolutely NO REGRETS of having to miss on anything special.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198624/?ref_=tt_urv

 A FEW QUICK WORDS ON "BORAT SUBSEQUENT MOVIEFILM" (2020),3,29,57,ericrnolan,28 October 2020,If you want to debate the ethics of Sacha Baron Cohen's prank-driven comedy; maybe there's a conversation to be had. The people subjected to his "Candid-Camera"-meets-"Jackass;" politically charged; ambush-style comedy are typically very unhappy about it. And I realize that Cohen (like any one else) should not be immune to criticism.But the man's work is damned hilarious; you can't argue with that. Like 2006's "Borat;" this new film made me laugh out loud repeatedly (even if I cringed at times too). "Borat Subsequent Moviefilm" is simply a first-rate comedy; I'd rate it a 10 out of 10.This is due largely to Cohen's twofold genius. First; he succeeds in creating a truly funny fictional character that could easily make us laugh in a scripted TV sitcom; or a "Saturday Night Live" sketch. Second; Cohen again demonstrates his mind-boggling ability to gain the trust of his targets - and then manages to stay in character throughout the elaborate pranks. (If you think about it; it's probably tougher than we might realize. There can't be any second takes for what we see unfolding before us onscreen.)A movie like this easily might have suffered from the addition of a second comedian who isn't as funny as Cohen. But newcomer Maria Bakalova hits it out of the park. (She plays the fictional daughter of Cohen's titular bumbling foreigner.) She is nearly as funny (and just as good at keeping character) as he is. With Sacha Baron Cohen; that's saying a lot.Again; some of what you see in this film will be cringe-inducing. But it's damned funny stuff.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6212653/?ref_=tt_urv
 Stinky Doo-Doo,10,43,89,DJB126,23 October 2020,Even looking past the political propaganda bs; this movie was hard to watch more than half the time. All the daughter bits were boring. If he had made fun of both political sides; this movie could've been better. Imagine the reactions he would've gotten if he'd gone to a BLM rally dressed in MAGA merch. If he crashed a Biden rally; made fun of pelosi. Those would've been huge laughs. I'm not even really that bothered by the Trump jokes; but don't be so biased about it. Go for both parties equally.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199077/?ref_=tt_urv
 so funny and amazing,10,24,46,narimanshaxo,31 October 2020,In my opinion Sacha baron cohen is one of the best comedians of all time; he's an absolute genius and yes of course the second borat is really great and i enjoyed it so much.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6222506/?ref_=tt_urv
 Even better than I thought,2,24,46,sismagilova,31 October 2020,Hilarious! Brilliant; bold; exposing! Real! The Bulgarian actress was perfect. The set up scenes were so well planned out. So much thought went into it. Perfectly exposes the current culture of humanity.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6222451/?ref_=tt_urv
 Satire, but at whose expense...,1,39,80,karlmartin-47352,23 October 2020,Whilst I appreciate that this is supposedly a satirical look at the USA I find it quite deplorable to continue to play into the hands of the Holocaust deniers. Also; the ridiculous amount of sexism & antisemitism is so shameful that I'd bet even Jim Davidson & the rest of the British 1970's comedians would wince at.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199326/?ref_=tt_urv
 horrible movie,1,43,90,tadeozapata,24 October 2020,Just a piece of democratic publicity. Horrible. Totally unfunny,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202647/?ref_=tt_urv
 So done with him!,7,43,90,lpittman-430-521576,23 October 2020,Don't waste your time. So obviously a set up with professional actors and not the slightest bit funny. The sets are so sparse and staged.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200004/?ref_=tt_urv
 Good but not anywhere near it's predecessor,1,64,140,AzgotheDefiler,23 October 2020,This was a good one time watch but it is is no way a match to the predecessor . Sure it does has its own funny scenes a lot of them but sometimes it felt as if the screen were scripted and even if they aren't they lacked the surprise thing/unpredictability like in the first part .Sacha Cohen was amazing as always with his comedic timing ; the girl also did a pretty decent job . Overall a good one time watch .,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198680/?ref_=tt_urv
 Boring, Agenda Heavy, Cringey Garbage.,9,121,280,harryfingus,23 October 2020,None of the humor or charm of the original.
This exaggerated corpse is brought back to life solely to awkwardly push a heavy handed political message.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198251/?ref_=tt_urv
 Far beyond a comedy: incredibly intelligent political satire,1,40,84,rzahrai,24 October 2020,Far more politically exposing than the first; Borat 2 is a raw expose of US power and political relations far beyond slapstick humour. The inconsistencies in American right-wing factional thought; mysogynism and the moral laxity of an uninformed; conspiracy theory touting conservative base is brought to light with some intelligent humour and outright outrageous scenes. This is smarter than a mere 90 mins of pranks -- this is a message of how compromised American democracy is today.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201730/?ref_=tt_urv
 Some high, highs, but too many low, lows. Cant tell if I loved it, or hated it.,2,31,63,rnickm,24 October 2020,Waited all this time for this; sat down with friends ready to cringe and laugh; and either we all just got old between films; or we loved it; and just couldn't laugh through our masks. A couple of strong laughs; but I'm reading reviews saying 9/10 and wondering what these people watched. No Luenell Either? I'm seeing that the bad reviews are woke and saying "Republicans or rednecks won't like it" of course people have to get political and not just watch it; and what would republicans be mad about; Giuliani scene was cringey more than funny; and if you didn't want to hang out with the cabin boys after; you clearly are enjoying 2020 being locked in. From my group what I could tell is; if you liked the daughter character you liked it a lot; if you didn't; obviously you won't. I probably should give it a 4; or a 7; but I guess to me it was like watching the sixth sense a second time. That's probably a dumb analogy; but I couldn't get past the novelty had worn off. I think I laughed more the 5 minutes before we watched it; talking about Borat 1; then during.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200642/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hard to stay engaged!,1,48,103,jafm-48063,23 October 2020,As much as I wanted this to be good; it was a disaster. the reports and reviews from others really got me excited; those folks need to broaden their horizons if this is doing it for them. I found the whole way through was a struggle to stay engaged; the humour was mild and few and far between... all in all forget this one SBC,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198266/?ref_=tt_urv
 Truly Awful - one of the worst films ever made,2,24,47,MuffRichardson,24 October 2020,As someone who would not be too offended by much or on any political divide I feel I am worthy of a fairly unbiased review. This film is truly atrocious. It speaks volumes that he had to return to an old character which lets be honest is past its sell by date. Whether this was because SBC is stuck for new material; money or is so desperate to push his own political agenda...it doesn't really matter; it should still be somewhat intelligent and entertaining. It's not; it's crass; crude; dumb toilet humour; fart jokes included. If this is your thing; go watch some of the scary movie series; at least that doesn't want to ram some political agenda down your throat at the same time as having to watch pure dumb unfunny muck.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203172/?ref_=tt_urv
 Political Agenda,3,57,125,rallder19,23 October 2020,I'm not a political person at all. Don't lean one way or the other with it. It's just not something that interests me.Unfortunately; this film just is all about bashing the president... and that's all. Honestly; though; it's not about the subject matter.. it could have been about anything; It's that it's like the same joke over and over and it just gets tired.Did not seem like Borat at all.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199113/?ref_=tt_urv
 One sided agenda,3,14,25,nph19,25 October 2020,The first movie was very good and made fun of everyone and everything. This new one is a reflection of the political bias of pop culture in today's society. I laughed at several parts but this has nowhere near the comedy of the first.It's very one sided. I'm pretty centrist but I could tell how biased this movie is. They only went after republicans. I wish that he would have gone after Democrats and their supporters too.I was thinking maybe he would go after the other side but it never happened. He just mocked Trump supporters by finding the most extreme ones. The ending just seemed like a very anti American message much like everything coming out of Hollywood today.This movie was good for a few good laughs but that's about it. I think Sasha Baren Cohen could've done so much better,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205973/?ref_=tt_urv
 Too Political,2,14,25,omax_m,25 October 2020,It had extreme political views compared with Borat 1; I think his daughter was a waste of time in the movie but probably the movie was motivated by feminists. It had very pro-Zionist views on things.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205604/?ref_=tt_urv
 A Buddy Movie with Borat,1,23,45,TheMarvellous,23 October 2020,I loved the first but this was terrible. The inclusion of his daughter was unneeded. By all means; have another character for Borat to interact with but get somebody who can do improv. His daughter ruined many scenes by laughing as Baron Coen ad-libbed. Too many scripted scenes and the terrible disguises (apparently needed because he is such a recognisable character now) ruin it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199833/?ref_=tt_urv
 Complete let down,3,65,145,aliceannewalters,23 October 2020,Seems to have been made with an agendaI used to like most of his filmsBiggest laugh is some hair on the armpits if you find that funny,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198966/?ref_=tt_urv
 So much more he could have done,10,96,222,lavaside-60237,23 October 2020,From the Russian Hoax; to Biden sniffing people; to cancel culture - the left wasn't touched with a 10 ft pole.
It not only was all 'Trump-centric' - it wasn't based upon the real jokes to be made; it was based upon the caricature of the right that the left tell themselves is the truth.
And the worst part - that was the funniest parts.
70% of the movie is about him and his daughter; with the same joke being rehashed 100 different ways.
If you liked the 1st Borat; it is at least watchable for a one-time viewing; so I gave it 3/10. But I'd watch the 1st 100xs over before ever watching this again.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198429/?ref_=tt_urv
 Relax and enjoy,1,29,59,brangel24,27 October 2020,I liked it; everyone gets so upset when their political views get made fun of. It's fine; people have opposing views. I like jokes about both sides and borat 2 had me cracking up and uncomfortable; overall it was very enjoyable. 8/10 but I'm offsetting the 1/10 votes by people who can't take a joke,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6209576/?ref_=tt_urv
 Only Democrats "love" this garbage. Worst ever Cohen movie,3,22,43,oregon007,24 October 2020,I have seen all of Cohens movies; and they have been on a decline since the first.They have gone from hilarious to utter garbage. Me and my partner watched this last night and neither of us found the movie funny. I think we both laughed once in 90 mins. And even that was not that funny a scene.We cannot understand the high ratings for this movie. It is so rubbish.The only explanation for the high ratings is that those giving it a 10 are Democrat voters who will hate on Trump and his party to such a degree they will give a huge thumbs up and ratings to anything that ridicules Trump/Republicans.This is stupid. Just because a movie portrays the Trump administration in a bad light does not automatically mean it is deserving of a 10 star rating and is the funniest thing on the planet. It absolutely does not.I am not a fan of Trump but this movie is sewer garbage. I wouldn't bother.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201653/?ref_=tt_urv
 Move along...nothing (new) to see here...,1,34,71,Dooptastic,23 October 2020,If you've seen the first Borat film; you've seen this one too. Nothing new. Same crude jokes; same Kazakhstan-bashing; same subtle racism; same sexism...the list goes on.The only new element is his daughter. To be fair; she was great; but it's a shame she was in this rehash and not the first film.I struggled to watch this to the end; as the pranks (as shocking as they were); weren't anything new.Think of it like the all Home Alone spin-offs that Macauley Culkin wasn't in. You know what's coming; same premise; same goofy criminals; same traps; same outcome; just a different kid.Might be enjoyed if you haven't seen the first instalment.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199008/?ref_=tt_urv
 Awful,1,21,41,gregorwhyte,24 October 2020,Don't waste your time ; absolute drivel ; enjoyed the first one but this is completely unfunny,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203153/?ref_=tt_urv
 Dumber than the first one...,1,21,41,johnkenerson,24 October 2020,At least the first one had some funny moments just because of the absurd nature of the scenes and his anonymity.This one is unfunny; cliched and just plain stupid. And of course it's supposed to be a hatchet job on republicans; but even clever editing and out of context footage can't save this piece of crap.Not worth a watch.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202993/?ref_=tt_urv
 Tired format predictable woke narrative,4,24,48,haywoodjablowmi,24 October 2020,SBC used to be funny and ground breaking; this is just tired same old shock you with cringe stuff that's really not amusing; laced with the woke narrative that Hollywood can't do without; disappointing and dull,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202962/?ref_=tt_urv
 Don't expect much,7,24,48,adamcdavis,23 October 2020,I laughed a few times at the start of the movie and then I realised it was rubbish. Such a shame. I was well up for a good laugh. Didn't happen.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199717/?ref_=tt_urv
 Better than they have any right to be - entirely thanks to Sacha Baron Cohen,7,11,19,r96sk,1 November 2020,These films are way better than they have any right to be - entirely thanks to Sacha Baron Cohen.I enjoyed 'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm' more than its predecessor from 2006; which relied too heavily on shock sex humour for my liking - though I did still like it all in all. This sequel is a little more creative with its jokes; whilst still having the necessary silliness and cringe.Cohen is excellent as he reprises the role of Borat. He made me laugh a number of times; any other actor in this role simply wouldn't be funny - he somehow makes it work expertly; his perfect delivery being crucial.In the first film; Cohen had Ken Davitian alongside him. Davitian doesn't return which is a shame; but he isn't missed to be honest. Maria Bakalova steps in very well; I feared her Tutar character was going to be irritating but she's anything but - Bakalova holds her own alongside Cohen.It's amusing; in ways that are indeed funny but also in ways that you know you shouldn't be laughing at - though that's critical to these films working. It also has the same Punk'd feel that the original production has.Good satire.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6224187/?ref_=tt_urv
 Where does one begin !?,10,44,96,scottedwards-87359,23 October 2020,With any SBC film you kinda know what you're going to get; and this doesn't disappoint. It is simultaneously hilarious; uncomfortable; genius; depraved; and jaw dropping in its brutal exposure of ignorance.The highlight is actually the actor who plays Borats daughter (Maria Balakova) Great performance and very gutsy lady to perform like that under what must be bizarre circumstances. Also; the scene shot in a Synagogue with a pair of elderly Jewish ladies is very touching indeed.It's obvious that filming was caught out by Covid; and the ending a little rushed; but overall it works very well.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198626/?ref_=tt_urv

 Once again offers a hilarious critique on modern American culture with that signature satirical edge only a character actor like Sacha Baron Cohen could ever bring,8,16,30,MrDHWong,29 October 2020,"Borat Subsequent Moviefilm" is the sequel to the 2006 mockumentary "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan". Starring Sacha Baron Cohen in the lead role; it once again offers a hilarious critique on modern American culture with that signature satirical edge only a character actor like him could ever bring.After the worldwide release of his first documentary film; Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) returns home to Kazakhstan to discover that he has humiliated his entire country in the process and is sent to the gulag for a lifetime of punishment. Fourteen years later; Borat is released at the request of the country's leader and tasked with delivering a renowned monkey to US President Donald Trump in an attempt to fix Kazakhstan's reputation. Realising that it would be impossible for him to reach Trump due to his actions in the first film; Borat instead decides to gift the monkey to Vice President Mike Pence. At the fear of being executed; Borat sets off on his second trip to US and A with the monkey in a container; unaware that his previously unknown daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) has stowed away on board.The original "Borat" film still holds a special place in my heart as one of my all time favourite comedies. I still have fond memories of quoting it verbatim and reenacting some scenes with friends when it first came out. I even cited the film as an example of a "Journey" as part of my final high school English exam. So it should come as no surprise that I was quite excited to hear that there would be a follow-up; especially considering Sacha Baron Cohen had previously stated that he would be retiring the character permanently a long time ago. With that in mind; I can say that this is definitely a sequel that we have needed more than ever. Considering how much America; and indeed the whole world for that matter; has changed in the past fourteen years; a character like Borat making his humorous; outdated observations certainly brings the humour in thick and fast as one by one his victims fall prey. Viewers of Baron Cohen's previous work should know what to expect when watching this film; as it is littered with some highly politically incorrect jokes and the odd use of gross-out humour. If this type of comedy offended you the first time around; then I guarantee it will offend you here as well. You have been warned.Due to the success of the original; Borat has become an enduring figure of pop culture; even after more than a decade. This would naturally make it difficult for a sequel to be made without people recognising the character in the streets; as part of what made him funny in the first place was the unsuspecting public believing him to be a real journalist from Kazakhstan. To work around this issue; we see Borat wearing disguises and speaking in a different accent when talking with some interviewees. Most of these were as funny as ever; although some of the aliases felt very hit-and-miss. That's not to say they weren't any less amusing; it's just that I preferred to see Borat himself talking to people and not some random man in a fat suit sporting a fake nose and speaking in an exaggerated Texan accent. In this film; we see Borat tackling subjects such as advances in technology; the sharp political divide in America; and of course the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns affecting the world. It's hard for me to discuss in detail the funniest parts without spoiling them so you'll just have to see for yourself. All I will say is that most of them are near the end.Even though he said in the past he would never play the character again; Sacha Baron Cohen seamlessly brings the loveable Kazakh journalist back as if he never left to begin with. All of his trademark quirks and catchphrases are there for us to enjoy; and he still has the power to shock us with his raw look at how things are in America right now. It is truly a great showcase of what a comic genius this man is and how we need more daring comedians like him to make us laugh and think of the current state of affairs in the world. However; I must also bring attention to newcomer Maria Bakalova as Borat's daughter Tutar. I'll admit I was concerned at first that she would be another typical female version of a male character shoehorned in to attract a broader audience but to my surprise she actually ended up stealing the show in quite a few scenes. Tutar's curiosity about the world beyond her home country made for some nice moments between father and daughter; as the former warms towards her and accepts that she is capable of so much more than just the traditional values she had been taught since birth. This added an air of sweetness to the film; albeit; in the comedic style one would expect here; but sweetness is still sweetness regardless.Although I think the original was marginally better; "Borat Subsequent Moviefilm" still packs that same comedic punch that provides the right amount of laughs in these trying times. It comes as a breath of fresh air to see a film like this taking potshots at subjects that most modern comedians are either too scared to touch or have given up on entirely. I don't know if we will ever get a third Borat film in the future but I also never imagined we'd get a second one either; yet here we are. If we do; it would probably take another fourteen or so years to complete; but for now; this hilarious second entry is a great success. High five!I rate it 8/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6215072/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious moments, and bound to offend some people,1,16,30,will_lambert,27 October 2020,Funny with some really hilarious moments; with one or two slow bits preventing me giving a 10.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6211976/?ref_=tt_urv
 Cruel and Lazy,2,16,30,doschlance,25 October 2020,If you laugh while pulling off wings of flies; this is for you. It's a poor; uninspired repeat of the first movie. Making fun of Southerners (already done); Texans (done); and Republicans (done again). I don't know if this was purely a money grab or political panic from just another Hollywood creator.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206677/?ref_=tt_urv
 Makes me sick,2,16,30,galetinv,24 October 2020,I'm not a US citizen; not a Repulican nor a fan of Trump. Having said that this movie feels lazy; safe; boring; predictable and extremely one sided. Being released so close to elections it's not even trying to hide its intentions. It's picking the most easiest targets. The Christians and Republicans. What's so brave about that? Of course there will be no consequences. If he wanted to make something meaningful; he should've mixed it up a bit. There are many things to expose about American society; or society in general; on either side of the argument. Of course people on the other side of spectrum; people who are not mocked here; will like it. And they are not entirely virtuous and without flaws. Not entirely blameless. And what's so righteous about that? Mocking people on the other side and not being entirely truthful. Where is the risk? Where is the effort? People who agree with him will say it's funny; it's great; and people who disagree will hate it. Like I said in the beginning. Lazy; safe; boring; predictable; makes me sick is what it is.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202331/?ref_=tt_urv
 Its Ironic,1,26,53,benjaminlauriesmith,23 October 2020,Its ironic that the movie is about an actor who is deceiving the supposedly less intelligent members of the southern united states as I'm assuming the audience won't be those who have been targeted in the movie leaving the 'intelligent' northerners to enjoy the movie?This brings me to my point; which is simply that to enjoy the movie you would have to either have an I.Q lower than the national average or have an I.Q still in development i.e that of a child but as the movie is rated 'R' I'm going to assume no responsible parent would let their child watch the movie. So who the movie is aimed at is quite the mystery.The critics reviews are also perplexing as reading their reviews they talk about an average movie at best which gets good in the last half hour if you stick with it but its not as good as the first and yet they are still awarding it 4 or 4.5 star out of 5Its clear there is an agenda in the movie but it seems utterly lost in a what is a confusing movie. It shows a lot of shops selling things to Borat and his daughter and ignoring anything they say to make the sale; is that a dig at capitalism or just the greed of humanity?It shows a woman showing genuine concern for Borat's daughter and her proposed plastic surgery and her lack of understanding of her body.It shows the Russel family take in a foreigner during a national epidemic and tolerate his cultural differences; it also tries to highlight their 'southern prejudices' as they talk about Democrats drinking blood.It then shows Borat in disguise singing a song about injecting the virus and the crowd are singing along then the Russel family help to reunite Borat and his daughter.I wanted to turn the movie off after the first twenty minutes but having read the reviews I stuck with it to see the good last half hour but even then its just a slog.Honestly; the only shocking thing about this movie is the high reviews its been getting.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199626/?ref_=tt_urv
 Sacha Baron Cohen getting used by QAnon? Not Funny!,10,23,46,brunni-30223,25 October 2020,Quoting the NY Times: He said he moved in with two conspiracy theorists for a few days to show "that they're ordinary folks who are good people; who have just been fed this diet of lies".Well if Cohen is not feeding us lies here; he probably has done QAnon a favor. Those guys are clearly in on the joke and indeed look agreeable besides Borat. I bet they do not regret a single word. It actually looks like *they* got *him* to sing their Wuhan flu song at the rally.The movie has some funny moments but this - together with the absolutely irresponsible attempt at Giuliani - ruined it for me.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203911/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious,7,10,17,reaper-68534,2 November 2020,Don't listen to critics so much and form your own opinions; anyone with no sense of humor will pick this movie apart,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6231469/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat 2 - Movie Review,1,10,17,alexpitt-345-971699,1 November 2020,I'll start my review by saying that I didn't enjoy Borat 2 as much as the first film. The original Borat was lightning in a bottle; and it was difficult to recapture the same magic fourteen years later.That being said; this is still a good film. The narrative was on par with the original; but this film had an extra layer of heart to it which I thought worked extremely well. The relationship between Sacha Baron Cohen and his daughter was very sweet; meaning that a few scenes towards the end affected me in the way they were supposed to.Unfortunately; my main complaint with Borat 2 was the lack of humour. There were a couple of jaw-achingly hilarious scenes; but they were few and far between. Most of them were in the first half of the film; meaning that the second half was completely devoid of any real laughs and this meant that the pacing also suffered.It's certainly nowhere near as funny as the first film; although I found that the pacing in the second half of the original Borat was also a little weak.That being said; the narrative was entertaining enough and the heartfelt moments worked for me; so I would definitely recommend this film. However; if I'm ever in the mood to watch one of these films; I'll probably just watch the original.SCORE: 72%,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6228056/?ref_=tt_urv
 One of the worst movies I've ever seen,10,5,7,hzumhve,8 November 2020,Sacha has lost his touch ; definitely trying to push an agenda and isn't even funny while doing it. Borat was one of the best movies I'd ever seen. This is a terrible follow up.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6245767/?ref_=tt_urv
 A perfect mirror of today's politics,10,22,44,bhofberger,29 October 2020,It's unbelievable how extreme today's views in politics have become. Hopefully this movie gets a few people thinking,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6216902/?ref_=tt_urv
 Awesome. The Only Good Thing Of 2020,8,15,28,itendrakumar,27 October 2020,Awesome and a complete fun ride in entirety. Best Comic Actor there is ; Good Direction and Actress did good too .
Love you Borat :),https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6211863/?ref_=tt_urv
 Further Improvised Iteration!,7,9,15,mikbanerjee1,2 November 2020,Sacha Baron Cohen is back again with a continuation of the worldwide phenomenon i.e. "Borat". A further refined iteration; now with a political influence; it bounds to get controversial & polarized yet again!
After a colossal hit with Borat; the team comes back for a vastly anticipated sequel.
Filming in the midst of the Corona Pandemic & upcoming imperative US Elections.
A political stance was imminent looking at the apparent scenario.
The stakes were too high both physically & mentally. An onerous test; they had passed with flying colours.Writing has drastically improved.
A supplemental cohesiveness in the screenplay segment has worked wonders here!
The comedy is seasoned now; one liners have gotten more uproarious and the storyline too got its due reformation!As for the performances; we get to see yet another triumph from Sacha as well as an astonishing act from Maria Bakalova.
Credit where it's due; She has gone toe to toe with Sacha; even overshadowed him in quite a few sequences! A talent indeed to watch out for!In a few words; I had an invigorating time with this sequel. Wacky Humour endorsed by scintillating performances; A formula for unassailable success.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6229480/?ref_=tt_urv
 Relevant and Extremely Funny,4,9,15,mbhgkmsgg,1 November 2020,What can you really say about this film? It's peak Sacha Baron Cohen. The character of Borat is outrageous both with his jokes and the audacity of his public stunts. Thanks to that; Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is endlessly entertaining; and it couldn't have come out at a better time.By far the best thing about this film is the jokes. It is an incredibly funny movie. I was laughing out loud for most of the film and sometimes had a hard time believing what I was hearing. The thing that makes this film that much funnier (or perhaps scarier?); is that these are real people that Borat is interacting with.
Certainly; a lot of jokes are very dark; and if you don't like that kind of humour then steer clear of this movie. However; if you don't mind that; Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is hilarious.The story part of the movie; however; felt a little out of place. It's good that there was an underlying motive for the character to do what he did. However; I did feel like a lot of the more serious and contemplative scenes didn't add much to the film. Indeed; they ended up disrupting what was an endless barrage of jokes and made the movie feel longer than it was.Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is a great comedy. It is extremely funny but it also manages to underline a lot of the social difficulties that America currently faces. So please watch it now; while it's still relevant. You'll have a great time.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6226695/?ref_=tt_urv
 Everyone should thank Trump to inspire Sacha Baron Cohen to do Borat again!,9,34,73,edwardhughes-37431,23 October 2020,This movie has an obvious political agenda and ain't afraid to hide it. The show provides the viewers an illusion of honest interactions between Borat and (supposedly) average American Republicans who appears to be oblivious to the cameras. For a movie that tries to get authentic reactions felt like it missed the bar and paid. The only people I found authentic are the doctor at the pro life clinic; the Trump supporters at the rally and all of them who got their faces blurred at the concert. ***SPOILERS**** Besides that the only authentic reaction from a person that I believe is Rudy Giuliani where Borat's daughter took advantage of Giuliani's kindness (and naivety) by pretending to be a journalist and having an interview with him. After the interview has concluded you can see Borat's daughter setting up Giuliani by pretending to help him remove the wires from his clothes. Then Borat rushes into the room saying to take him instead of his daughter insinuating that Giuliani is a creep who is willing to get in bed with an underage girl (at least to the audience with heavy and nearly perfect editing).Sure the movie is funny at times and had some good cringe worthy scenes in there. But it ain't enough to redeem it especially when there is a decisive motive behind it. Like one scene in the movies insinuates black trump supporters complementing trump on twitter of Facebook are fake and made by spammers from a third world country. Sure laughter brings people together but the laughter that Cohen provides is one that's only decisive and adds fuel to the fire.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199107/?ref_=tt_urv
 2020 Summary,10,24,49,victor_correra,27 October 2020,This movie is basically a summary of 2020; mainly in the US; possibly the world.It shows how seductive conspiracy theories have become; and how people are easily manipulated.They touch on so many conspiracy theories that it's hilarious to see that people actually believe them.Also; let's remember this movie is supposed to be funny. I'm sure the bad reviews here are from people that think their ideas are the supreme truth. And when they see their ideas are so ridiculous that even Borat is making fun of them; people get offended and can't handle it.In order to watch it; you have to have some knowledge of what is going on in the US; and all the things happening with / around Trump.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6210330/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarity and worth watching,1,18,35,craigandrewriley,28 October 2020,Well just finished watching Borat Subsequent Moviefilm and it was absolutely hilarious. I'm guessing the reviewers leaving 1-star reviews don't understand satire; there's no doubt clever people will get it. The ending wraps it up nicely with dare I say a fulfilling sense of pride. Very much a product of its time; and I for one am looking forward to revisiting it in five or ten years time and reflecting back on this period we're all going through.
And; why do people say "I couldn't even watch 10 minutes of it" and then leave a review? YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED if you don't watch the whole thing! It really demonstrates the unintelligence of the "reviewer".,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6212858/?ref_=tt_urv
 Clearly rushed for election.,1,18,35,dhapetersen,26 October 2020,Their motives are very transparent. Rushed out in order to influence the 2020 election results. And not even funny! I'm greatly disappointed.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207128/?ref_=tt_urv
 Nothing like the original.,1,18,35,yjxajdbs,24 October 2020,I absolutely adored the original as it was shown for everyone and the jokes were amazingly offensive meanwhile staying funny.
I'm not sensitive at all and I laugh at absolutely everything that's deemed horrible to others; but
The second one.
It just applies to Americans. Good thing I watched it through a trial and not on a subscription as it was not worth it at all.
There were exactly 4 times I laughed at this movie. The most at the Jewish part in the church(But also only the beginning) and the very end when they're reporting.
This was such an American propaganda it was painful for me to watch.
Almost all the movie was scripted unlike the original and it was not funny.
The original one had genuine reactions from people but this was just plain and boring.
I wouldn't even think about watching this dumpsterfire again. I'd rather watch the original for the nth time.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203510/?ref_=tt_urv
 Juvilile humour,1,18,35,jcdentonunatco-04501,24 October 2020,There were a couple funny parts; but really this is a juvenile movie that set out to make fun of American conservatives. The humor is very cringey; and appeals mostly to an immature audience.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202516/?ref_=tt_urv
 Disappointed,9,29,61,nufasn1987,23 October 2020,I couldn't even get through the first half hour; he's alot older now and his borat voice is shot. The voice alone ruined it for me. Maybe ill try again in a few days.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200068/?ref_=tt_urv
 Worthy sequel,1,21,42,masonsaul,27 October 2020,Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is a worthy sequel that's as good; if not better; than it's predecessor. It's reliably funny; shocking and extremely relevant. Sacha Baron Cohen is once again perfect with Maria Bakalova giving an equally fearless performance. The majority of the jokes are really funny and shocking making up for the few that aren't as good. It's extremely well paced and Jason Woliner's direction is great. The music by Erran Baron Cohen is fantastic.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6209878/?ref_=tt_urv
 Absolute disgrace,10,21,42,kolevradoslav,24 October 2020,This movie is the absolute disgrace.Within 30 minutes of watching I realized I had no idea what Im watching and just turned it off.There was absolutely nothing funny about it; no jokes; no laughs; just one disgraceful non funny joke after the other.This is absolutely the worst type of cinema one can get.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202824/?ref_=tt_urv
 Funny. Funny. Funny,10,8,13,David241,3 November 2020,Borat. This was some Michelangelo level humor. I'm a fan for life. Thank you for giving the world something to laugh at during this pandemic.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6232737/?ref_=tt_urv
 Wonderful story with excellent ending.,7,8,13,MartyKrz,2 November 2020,I watched this sequel to the first Borat movie and I wholeheartedly recommend this one. It has a well written storyline while speaking volumes regarding the American condition. His costar as his daughter is captivating and believable and the whole film is actually told with heart if you can belive that. When you can; check out the many back stories regarding the making of the film which will give incredible insight to it's making on Youtube.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6231628/?ref_=tt_urv
 #2 is #1 and right on time!,9,8,13,themikedup,1 November 2020,As always Cohen delivers a gem! This has a plot and well designed story line that carved its humor like a slice of apple pie!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6224425/?ref_=tt_urv
 Funny and fresh,10,14,26,pkacarov-31791,31 October 2020,I enjoy this movie! For sure it is not the best comedy of the century but can make you laugh.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6221576/?ref_=tt_urv
 Better than I was expecting!,10,14,26,katecoonan,28 October 2020,Had the same humor as the first one but seemed much more thought out and planned; and the girl that played the daughter was great! So crazy that Sacha Baron Cohen got the Vp and the presidents lawyer like that lol,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6212175/?ref_=tt_urv
 The best comedy movie I watched in the last years,3,14,26,bmalashev,27 October 2020,Well done Sacha Baron Cohen. This movie really made me laugh from the heart. Thank you also for choosing the best actress for your daughter. As a Bulgarian and mostly her friend; I am really pround and happy. You all deserve nominations and Oscar's! I cannot believe how hard it was to act all the time and do such a great performance. I am waiting the next movies of her with big impatience. I always knew it she will climb to the top of Hollywood some day. And here is the day. This movie made me very very happy.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6211953/?ref_=tt_urv
 democratic party agenda,1,14,26,hosseinmasumi,25 October 2020,Unlike the first movie this movie is just democratic party agenda and attacking trump and the republicans . a very weak sequel . it aint funny at all there are some funny moments but in comparison to borat 1 its nothing,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206085/?ref_=tt_urv
 waste of time,9,31,66,hafezmaka,24 October 2020,I love Sacha Barron but this movie is completely a disaster. if you respect for your time don't even come close to this movie.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201017/?ref_=tt_urv
 YES YES YES,9,23,47,hfreinoso,29 October 2020,I LOVED Borat when it first came out. I was a huge fan that first movie I could NOT... and I mean NOT stop laughing. So with this one I was expecting it to be hilarious just as the first one. And I GOT that. Everything that Sacha did was hilarious and his daughter played by Maria Bakalova was brilliant in the movie ; I swear I though she WAS Sacha's daughter. They both played it so good. Everything made me laugh and it was so funny to a pulp. Is it better than the first movie.... NO. Was it just as good.... Yes. This movie has the most offensive stuff in it. From Women to race to gender to everything even the pandemic was JOKED in this movie. PLEASE if you get easily offended.... please don't bother on watching it. I for one can take a joke of race;gender; sexualty etc. I though this film did it's best and it is one of my favorite of 2020 (Not saying much since a lot have left 2020 to 2021) 9/10.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6215996/?ref_=tt_urv
 Best Documentary of 2020!,1,23,47,generationlead,26 October 2020,This is the best documentary of 2020...much more well-researched and fact-based than Plandemic!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6209490/?ref_=tt_urv
 What a waste of time an brain matter.,8,23,47,janenb,23 October 2020,This movie is nothing but stupid. No witty puns; double entendres; zingers; just more of Borat being crude beyond measure. Adolescent humor at its lowest.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200152/?ref_=tt_urv
 I will come back. Yakshi Mash!,9,17,33,frazier99,29 October 2020,The main source of pleasure from watching any segment of Borat (or movie in general) is watching "normal" people who find themselves in unfamiliar situations trying to get out of such difficult circumstances. The first Borat was mostly apolitical; interested in exposing American hypocrisy. Well; as it happens; the truth is stranger than fiction; even if the concept of truth simply does not exist in this case. The continuation; of course; is more like a propaganda campaign for Biden; but it must be said that it took Cohen 14 years to get Borat back on the screens. Realizing that this character was a victim of his own success and could no longer fool people; the Kazakh reporter's sequel is exhumed with all possible cynicism: he has evolved in the right direction and is not a blind copy of the original; yet the sequel has added interesting; relevant ideas to the modern world.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6215232/?ref_=tt_urv
 hilarious and shocking,10,17,33,FeastMode,29 October 2020,Wow. my jaw was dropped for a large portion of this movie. and it had me cracking up throughout. like a continuation of Who Is America? but with our favorite character. i've said this before and i'll say it again... sacha baron cohen is a genius. no one can do what he does. he is amazing at it.i never thought we'd get another borat movie after the original destroyed the world of comedy (top 2 comedy of all time). but we did. and it was amazing. (1 viewing; 10/23/2020),https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6214871/?ref_=tt_urv
 Better than the original in almost every way.,8,17,33,ac_rulz_mf,28 October 2020,I'm not going to lie; it's mad impressive that the Redneck song was somehow way funnier in the actual context of this movie than watching it happen in real life all those months ago.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213390/?ref_=tt_urv
 Just little rated movie so be careful,1,13,24,aahankhan-67510,29 October 2020,You can go for its awesome so many valgur scene buy funny too just keep that in mind,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6215457/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat 2: Thanks for shortening the title,3,42,94,krazysoon,23 October 2020,Not sure who this film is for...obviously not me. While I enjoyed the first one; the second film isn't all that funny. If you want shocking; this is your film. If you want to see the genitals of a monkey (No; Really) this is your film. Pretty tasteless actually. But I'll give it to Borat; the film has its funny moments; and when I say funny I mean gut busting. Maybe I'll give the film a second chance. But until then my rating stands. Heck I'd rather watch Joker (2019) again and I despise that movie. Watch at your own risk. If you want to fully enjoy the film; watch it with your spouse or friends. I watched it with my mom. She was appalled by what was happening in the film. She thought the previews were funny but the film not so much. Vile; disgusting; humorous; horrible; unique and it shows the true flaws of America. As I said before; not my film. And definitely not my mommas film. So guess who will be in church Sunday? This guy....,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199324/?ref_=tt_urv
 Pure political propaganda,10,75,179,beschuitfluiter,23 October 2020,This is nothing more than Baron Cohen being the political activist he is. Still kinda funny but it's a shame the virtue signalers of hollyweird keep pushing their entitled narrative,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198459/?ref_=tt_urv
 HILARIOUS,10,75,179,james-hockey98,23 October 2020,This movie was incredible I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in years!! I highly recommend watching it,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197652/?ref_=tt_urv
 Thank you for exposing the trash that needs to be taken out!,8,39,87,shannonreonas,24 October 2020,I loved this film; was happy to see the Macon purity ball put on blast. Thank you for doing what you do Sasha!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202070/?ref_=tt_urv
 2020 was good for Sacha Baron Cohen,8,12,22,sinahaase-960-743497,28 October 2020,I liked the movie. I don't remember everything of the first one so I need to rewatch it; but this one made me laugh. Rudy disgusts me even more thanks to SBC.I loved the scene in the synagogue. I also loved the song he sang at that qanon rally or whatever it was. Hilarious. Although; my husband who was watching with me didn't exactly love the Saudi remarks because he is from Saudi himself but still laughed lolWhat I love is how Sacha Baron Cohen can take American politics to a different level of comedy that creates awareness along with humor. It's funny; but it's also like; "omg is that really how it is?" type of wondering. A lot of late night talk shows and daytime media can do a decent amount of humorous journalism but Borat immerses himself in it. I read that Sacha stayed in character for 5 days with those 2 men and that is some crazy dedication! Haha!Sadly I forgot the actress' name at the moment of writing this review but I thought she was wonderful! Their chemistry was superb. All I know about her is that she's an amazing actress and that she's from Bulgaria I think...but I want to see/know more from her!
The movie was great in my opinion :) thanks for reading*Also; if you haven't seen the Trial of the Chicago 7; you must watch it! Like I said; it was a good year for Sacha Baron Cohen :),https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6214066/?ref_=tt_urv
 Funny,7,12,22,billcr12,28 October 2020,Sasha Baron Cohen is back as Borat; the intrepid journalist; and this time he mostly takes on McDonald Trump and Mike Pence. If you are a MAGA hat wearing viewer; you will be offended; but for all others; you will love Borat. It begins with our star in a gulag for offending his nation in the first film. He is released to bring honor to his nation by delivering a gift to Mike Pence. At first it is a monkey but later turns out to be his teenage daughter. Not as good as the first film; but still very funny.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213573/?ref_=tt_urv
 High-five!,3,12,22,hensmichr,27 October 2020,I had to see this subsequent moviefilm in a slightly inebriated state of mind. I didn't wanna watch this sober. But I laughed. And I laughed. Many times. Borat delivered again. I would have given it a higher mark than a 7 if it wasn't for the Giuliani part. That segment felt a bit like an unfair ambush.
Maria Bakalova; however; did great. Kudos to her!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6211714/?ref_=tt_urv
 This is a party election broadcast for......,3,21,43,sandy-42121,23 October 2020,Should come with a warning; if you're not interested in American politics give it a miss.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199829/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat minus the spontaneity,1,21,43,nick-43302,23 October 2020,It's a drag. Starts out pretty good with some laughs in great Borat style. But where the first movie carried momentum through seemingly unscripted events which felt true; this sequel is 100% scripted.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199768/?ref_=tt_urv
 Absolutely the worst movie by Sacha.,10,18,36,martin-01272,26 October 2020,I forced myself to watch it to the very end with some hope that the movie would prove me wrong. Sadly I was wrong and I feel robbed for wasting my time and endured so much pain and torture with this horror film. The Borat sequel film is nothing like the original film It stinks more than rotting flesh and feels like you are receiving a lobotomy with every minute of watching it. It's like Sacha had nothing at all to do with the production except play a roll. I'm actually embarrassed for Sacha and myself. Wow.

 Great movie,9,15,29,kassemmohamed,28 October 2020,That's the real October surprise
He showed the real red necks and the real Qnaon stories,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6214470/?ref_=tt_urv
 Maybe this year isn't so bad after all,9,15,29,cyorke-34660,28 October 2020,This film was everything I expected; and in 2020 the humour of this film on my screen just makes it so much better; hopefully this can be the start of this sort of humour bringing its way back; yes people will complain because they have nothing better to do with their lives; but if you're like me and enjoy laughing then don't hesitate to watch this movieVERY NICE,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6212127/?ref_=tt_urv
 My first Borat film. Definitely worth the time,9,15,29,moten200,27 October 2020,I had never seen a Borat film before and only did so this time because of the media buzz. While I did not find the film very funny; I absolutely loved how the film exposed the hypocrisy of sleazy old Rudy. He lied about not doing "anything inappropriate." Aside from that; there were scenes I did not find funny but rather gross.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6211810/?ref_=tt_urv
 A smarter and better Borat showing how the most powerful are dangerously stupid,9,15,29,chrisrowexxx,27 October 2020,I thought the first film was ok; funny but just a bit much; I found this one to actually be really smart; I'm unsure how much of its staged; I mean the Rudy bit especially is just scary dodgy; I'm from the uk and I feel for Americans; such a huge country obviously differs from here but with guns; morons in charge and the vast gap in education between areas I couldn't imagine a worse place to live. I know parts are ok but being real it's just a dangerous place.The truths here were close to home but true; I saw so many rallies during lockdown in the USA compared to few if any here; I actually agree the virus is man made; I think the bat things just a lie. 2020 has been horrific and at times where many countries came together the USA is divided. Joke of a president who deserves jail... or drinking disinfectant,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6211759/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat is Back,1,27,58,onfrozenpond,23 October 2020,You either like SCB or you don't . I thought the movie wad hilarious and Borat and his daughter were a great duo . Obviously some are not going to like it but if you like a little satire in this scary time it's a great laugh .,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200206/?ref_=tt_urv
 saw it because it's Borat.,10,84,206,dh11969,23 October 2020,I am amazed by all forms of media in the last couple of years provide no escape from politics. I just wan to watch something to leave reality behind for a few.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198092/?ref_=tt_urv
 Excellent,1,20,41,isabellatallica,30 October 2020,I hope he never stops making those films. Yes they are daring and extreme but also shows the truth. Fantastic that he exposed the old creeps,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6219457/?ref_=tt_urv
 What a disgrace,1,2,2,bdnwhjppur,9 November 2020,While I had some good laughs; recording people without their consent is not ethical. It will get media attention and good sell/revenue; but that's not ethical way to make money in my opinion!! I would also argue there is hidden political agenda in making of this movie!! Just not best 2 hours of my life!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6248165/?ref_=tt_urv
 Peak cringe in 2020,6,2,2,joeygassert,8 November 2020,Usually when you watch a good comedy; you just laugh the whole time.Sadly for this movie; I cringed more times than I laughed. Not funny at all; especially the Holocaust prank.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6247731/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat is irrelevant now,6,2,2,PsychoBeard666,8 November 2020,There were a few moments when I laughed; but Borat as a character isn't relevant anymore. He doesn't have that anonymity to fool people and the situations are incredibly staged.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6245685/?ref_=tt_urv
 Decent enough,8,2,2,johnloane22,8 November 2020,Bit disappointed with this film; I guess the character has reached the end of the road. I loved the first movie and most of Baron Cohen's characters but this one felt a bit forced and not as funny as before.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6244905/?ref_=tt_urv
 He did it again!!,7,11,20,nicorip22,27 October 2020,I couldn't believe they were going to make another borat movie; nor did I expect it to be as good as the first one; it's a very good movie. If you like dark humor you really have to see it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6211683/?ref_=tt_urv
 OMEGALUL,9,11,20,drosewindy,27 October 2020,Borat is back; with this subsequent moviefilm. This will be compared to the original to no end; but with borat being a cultural icon in America; this one was bound to be very different.I loved this film; it made me topple with laughter multiple times. The accomplishment of making this within a pandemic is also a massive achievement. Do I think this is better then the first one? No. Do I think this is a hilarious movie? Absolutely.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6211274/?ref_=tt_urv
 Love...,10,17,34,developmentchapman,28 October 2020,How many people have been offended by this film gets an extra star for making Leigh Francis weep.Great film!!!!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6212060/?ref_=tt_urv
 More Of An 8, But Rated 10 to Counter the 1s,9,32,71,fayandray,23 October 2020,I loved the first one and this one is just as good. It may have been a little more staged; but I laughed as much as the last.The rating is so obviously being brought down by a certain type. Why do they bother to watch it at all; knowing what this satire is about?I actually liked the ending of this one better; probably because of the scripting. Nonetheless; good for a laugh.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200320/?ref_=tt_urv
 Best comedy of the year!!!,9,14,27,justin-fencsak,30 October 2020,The best funny film of 2020 is not at a theater near you (even closed cinemas in NYC and LA) but on your Fire Tablet and TV and also the prime video app on consoles and smart tvs. It's Borat Subsequent Moviefilm; the sequel to the box office surprise hit Borat from 2006 which was the first movie I saw at the AMC in Rockaway; NJ during its opening weekend and have since seen it a few times on DVD and on TV. 14 years after the original; about a Kazakhstan man making fun of the USA; finds Borat on a mission to find Rudy Guiliani and his GOP friends on a quest to raise his daughter which soon gets lost. Hilariousness ensues and there's lots of jokes and action in just 90+ minutes. Highly recommended and it might be nominated for some Oscar bait!!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6219851/?ref_=tt_urv
 FRIGHTENINGLY INSIGHTFUL!,9,19,39,lilydrage,27 October 2020,In an interview with Good Morning America Cohen admits that he believes the Giuliani was only fixing his shirt. But he tells then also that people are allowed to interpret for themselves. It is undeniable how uncomfortable Sacha is willing to push people to be so open. In the last movie I felt i comfy and shocked by the things people sad but I wasn't completely thrown aback. The faces we see and recognize in this wonderful concoction of modern fear are haunting. It's not just an innocent bystander. It's topical and it's brutally raw. Sadly it is a little one sided at points; which doesn't make for a thorough watch if you are looking to feel like everyone is getting it handed to them. Absolutely enjoyable if you are looking to be frightened by the state of America. It can be worryingly too close to home and surely isn't for the faint of heart.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6210251/?ref_=tt_urv
 Brilliant!,7,10,18,grahamimpollock,1 November 2020,It has been a long time since I laughed out loud so much at a comedy movie! Much better than the first one and very clever. The actress who played the daughter was brilliant too and a great addition to the storyline.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6226128/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilariously funny, in spells,1,23,49,grantss,24 October 2020,It has been 14 years since journalist Borat Sagdiyev embarrassed the nation of Kazakhstan with his visit to America and resulting documentary. He has spent those 14 years in a gulag but is now being released. The Premier of Kazakhstan has an important task for him: return to America and bribe the US Vice President in order that Kazakhstan regain favour.The first Borat film; released in 2006; was brilliant. Spinning off Borat; a secondary character in the TV series Da Ali G Show; into his own movie; writer-actor Sacha Baron Cohen created a hilariously funny film that combined candid comedy with staged skits. The success of the candid scenes was almost entirely due to the off-the-charts chutzpah and nerve of Cohen. Not only funny; the movie also made some interesting social observations; especially in demonstrating the superficiality of modern society.This film is the first Borat movie or release of any kind since the 2006 film. The fact that Cohen even decided to make it is interesting as you would think you can only make a candid film about a particular character once: they're bound to get recognised the second time round (even after a 14-year break).This was my fear before watching this: surely Cohen can't get away with it a second time? However; I needn't have worried. Through disguises and picking on people who've never heard of Borat; Cohen manages to replicate the candidness and anonymity of the first movie. The other major positive is here he isn't working alone: Maria Bakalova does a great job in playing Borat's daughter Tutar; getting many of the candid scenes and taking the pressure off Cohen/Borat.The result is a film that is; in spells; as funny as the original. Some great laugh-out-loud moments.However; it isn't as consistently funny as the 2006 film; with some scenes that miss the mark. There are still some good social observations but they aren't as many or as profound as in the original.Overall; very entertaining and well worth the watch; especially if you enjoyed the 2006 film.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201524/?ref_=tt_urv
 What Happened to Movies These Days!,1,27,59,imofrazier,23 October 2020,This is not only disgusting but extremely offensive! If you have any decency at all I don't advise watching. For sure keep innocent eyes and ears of children away from this horrible so called movie.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199753/?ref_=tt_urv
 Blatant attempt at pre election manipulation,1,16,32,aaronwills-87454,24 October 2020,If you can look past that there's nothing new compared to the last 2.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202755/?ref_=tt_urv
 Great idea, bad execution,10,16,32,enadyo,24 October 2020,No originality and too much fake scenes. Bad direction there!
Around the unsuspected people there are 2 or three moving cameras. Those are studio takes; made believe as "hidden camera". Very offending to the viewer's IQ!
Also; too many "Kazakstanian" dialogues; too many!
I love S. B. Cohen but that film was a Titanic (the shipwreck; not the movie)
Lastly it's obvious that Giuliani is fixing his shirt.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201740/?ref_=tt_urv
 The ugly truth of the USA,1,13,25,choompajnr,31 October 2020,So sad that it takes a comic genius to highlight the ugly side of the US&A,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6220297/?ref_=tt_urv
 Limp, lame and lacking laughs,7,18,37,khamilton-11,24 October 2020,Enjoyed the first Borat film but this was pitiful. Felt very staged; humour was base and tried to use unimaginative crass humour to drive the storyline; which in itself was pretty much non existent.Really struggled to watch to the end; with few laughs and nothing substantial that resembled any sort of meaningful social commentary on the current state of politics in the US. Contrived and lacking anything interesting bar a slightly creepy Rudy Guliiani - which seems to be the only selling point the media have latched on to (which is maybe a hint at how bad the rest of the content is for those bothered to watch to the end).For what it's worth; I'm from the UK; left leaning politically and very much anti Trump and his lackeys; which maybe makes the missed opportunity to do something clever and insightful; the biggest disappointment.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202807/?ref_=tt_urv
 Did Borat just save 2020?!,10,60,146,EddyTheMartian007,23 October 2020,(No Spoilers) Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bride to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2020) is a sequel to the cultural phenomenon that was the first film; Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006). I think it's safe to say most of us never expected this movie to happen; let alone be secretly filmed and release just a couple of months after its announcement. I also think it is safe to assume that most of us didn't think a sequel would be as good as the original. It would just be impossible to recapture the shocking satirical mockumentary that was the first one; but it's almost as shocking a sequel would be made today with all the political correctness; cancel culture; etc. that has become so prevalent in today's media. While this movie is definitely not as good as the original and some of its charm is lost since it has been already done before; and replicated; it still remains hilarious yet important.Sacha Baron Cohen still owns the role perfectly being as believable as the current pandemic. There's times where Sacha is acting as Borat; acting as an American; and it's as impressive as it is hilarious. The surprise star is Maria Bakalova as Tutar; Borat's daughter. When I first saw her character I was apprehensive as she seemed like she could become annoying fast; but she never was; and is the heart of the film. The movie definitely goes in cliched and predictable routes; despite the unpredictable pranks they pull; but they somehow make it work. This is definitely one of those movies I can see being even more divisive than the first. While the first was mostly loved it created a lot of controversy for its depiction of Kazakhstan; gross scenes; and its dark/offensive humor. Now add current day American politics; and a criticism of multiple hot button issues today; it will definitely leave some people sour. Plus; not everyone will enjoy the father daughter story if they're mainly here for the funny pranks; but if you stick with the story it will be greatly rewarding.This movie relies on shock humor so I won't be spoiling anything here. A Borat sequel could've easily failed if it didn't do a few things differently; and I think this movie succeeded. With Borat's cultural impact we've already seen similar movies and even TV shows recreate it; most notably The Eric Andre Show (which is equally as hilarious in my opinion); so this movie makes the smart move of focusing a little more on the actual story and characters of the film. This allows for the movie to have more of an emotional impact; and even moments of tension. There's a particular part where I found it to be genuinely intense. Maria Bakalova deserves insane praise for what she was able to accomplish going so deep into her role to even expose a real politician. We've heard about politicians doing these things for years; but seeing it happen; it was just gut wrenching. While the first film shows a broader view of US&A; this movie examines on a wider variety of topics and effectively criticizes them.Borat; once again; and Tutar achieve much success giving us a powerful social commentary of our times; but it does have some issues. As I mentioned earlier the storyline and character arcs are cliched and predictable. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bride to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2020) simply isn't as funny as the first film; Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006). While it still had me consistently laughing out loud throughout; there wasn't any moment where I was almost in tears from laughter like the first film. The social commentary works but isn't as effective like the first time around where it genuinely caught us off guard and made us pause to examine ourselves. All of these issues have already been heavily criticized and satirized; so it isn't as powerful as it could be. The first movie almost feels timeless; still applying to this day; but this movie focuses on issues (like COVID-19) right now that might not age well. There's a fantastic unpredictable twist near the end of the movie that really adds to the story; but I found the the actual ending to be a bit too silly even for Borat; using tired jokes that have been said by everyone already.Despite all these problems; I still had a great time. Did Borat 2 save 2020? No; I don't think anything can; but it is certainly one of the only gifts to come from this unbelievable and wretched year. Overall; Borat 2 very nice; deserves High Five! It is the still hilarious satirical dark humor we need today more than ever. It exposes our society; while still having a heart; and with 2 fantastic lead performances. Thank you for reading my review. I hope you like. Dziekuje!(7/10),https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197744/?ref_=tt_urv
 Brilliant Movie!!,4,60,146,nightcrawler-41342,23 October 2020,I have never laughed so hard.Cohen went after them all: countries that see women as second hand citizens and who's only purpose is to obey. He portrayed Melania as a ''lucky one'' for living in a gold cage rather than in a normal one. I think Giuliani was under the impression he is going to get lucky. Kind of reminded me of ''The Limo '' episode in Seinfeld where George was close to getting lucky to a nazi simpathiser. The Facebook touch was also brilliant as more and more people believe stories on their Facebook feed which could really be written by anyone who wants to have a laugh at the expense of gullible people. If you don't allready have prime get it and watch this movie. Nobody portraits the tragic reality we live in better than Borat!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197648/?ref_=tt_urv
 Nothing like the first one, except the Borat character,10,26,57,kitewizard,24 October 2020,Comparing Borat to Borat 2 is like comparing Disney's animated Aladdin to Aladdin 2.This is a political film that makes fun of Republicans and Kazakhstanis; and its targeted toward today's college students.
Sacha is riding the waves of where the money is; instead of doing anything original; like the first film.None of the big pranks are funny; but a couple of the less random; smaller jokes and gags; are.All Leftists will enjoy the film. Everyone else; will either not see it; or if they do; they will feel let down.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200565/?ref_=tt_urv

 Hats off pulling it off against the odds,10,31,70,vilaas-866-435621,24 October 2020,The movie might be 7+ rating however 10 when one thinks of the odds of making such a movie and not getting - arrested; punched; catching covid; is an achievement. Including the dialogs where retakes are not possible.Not sure timing of Borats entrance in hotel bedroom was deliberate or just coincidence that users were left to decide whether (avoiding taking names) was tucking in shirt or was going to beyond that.And it's not just for comedy; it's made for getting the message out on what's wrong with ~30-40% of America that got such an administration and it's supporting cronies elected.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202975/?ref_=tt_urv

 Borat 2 Is Pure Genius,10,9,16,chrisstineb,1 November 2020,I did not understand what people loved about the first movie because that type of humour is not my thing. The 2nd movie is pure genius. I laughed out loud throughout; but the laughs are not what makes this movie great. Borat 2 is a satirical look down the rabbit of current day America. We need more movies that point out the absurdity of current events.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6227108/?ref_=tt_urv
 Eyes wide open on USA's ugliness - A very courageous stand,1,15,30,bibouworldtraveler,25 October 2020,When reality as become a parody; laughing at it's buffoons is mandatory. If you didn't like the movie; the joke was probably on you.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204296/?ref_=tt_urv

 Enjoyable continuation from original film,9,23,50,SudaNim,24 October 2020,If you weren't a fan of the original Borat film; then this probably won't be a hit with you. If however; you were laughing at Cohen's antics in the original film; then you will know what to expect and will probably love it.Maria Bakalova was a co-star more than a supporting actress - likely down to Borat's notoriety from the original film - and the script relied heavily on her being convincing in her interactions with the American public. She pulled it off well.The standout moment featured Rudy Giuliani. Will be interesting to see how much damage that does to him...,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201445/?ref_=tt_urv

 BEST POLITICAL SATIRE EVER!,7,19,40,diego-armando-gallardo,27 October 2020,All the conservative yanks will be furious and leaving bad reviews to this movie; but that's just them crying out loud because they don't like to be criticized nor to be exposed on how their society and culture are imploding. But all those bad reviews mean that this movie it's a political satire masterpiece!This movie trashes very hard the behaviour and stupidity of American rednecks and their political leaders.God Bless Sacha Baron Cohen!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6210168/?ref_=tt_urv
 Just in time to SAVE a Sobering and Embattled 2020!! If you can't find humor here, start praying for 2021.,9,19,40,yrusuchamoron,24 October 2020,WHAT A GEM !!! Not until Borat #1 could I have found any value for SBC; since then he brought an authentic Comic Genius for those who dare.
I would have predicted "One and Done" after the 1st Bora; as
it seemed INCONCIEVABLE that there could ever be another made....BUT Gullible was I; this one is a TRUE MASTERPIECE!!!
Aside from the expected inappropriate yet laughable sacrilegious antics; anti-Semitism; racism; misogynistic themes; etc... again were the scenes where "simple American country folk" appear to be portrayed as if ignorant to the decade; in which some actually are; and they ain't acting.
BUT this time even the True Blue N.Y.C.'s Ex-Mayor; the actual Personal Attorney to the POTUS himself; RUDY G. was truly CLUELESS to the semi-private situation he was in as he "FIDDLED ABOUT"; not knowing just how not-private it really was.
Ok; so he's just another well-known senile and demented "Dirty Old Man" politician; but were "his people" not aware enough to protect him from himself? All he had to do was admit he had a great time participating in Borat 2 and acting along it for fun"; but he is not even that wise.WELCOME & BRAVO to Maria Bakalova; as she partnered up perfectly with SBC to double the comedic delivery of a much-needed "roll with the times" escape from the overflowing Year of DRAMA that 2020 has been; and still with a POTUS election yet to go.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201467/?ref_=tt_urv
 Much funnier than expected,10,21,45,FirstNameLastName24,24 October 2020,As a big fan of the original Borat film; I was obviously excited when the sequel was announced. However; I was fully aware of the stigma regarding sequels; and I tapered my expectations. Much to my surprise; I found the 2nd installment to be very enjoyable. Just like the original; The Subsequent Moviefilm has a large handful of shocking and laugh-out-loud moments. Borat 2 also has many somewhat amusing jokes; and several gags that aren't that funny; but this is to be expected from nearly any comedy these days. My only real criticism of the sequel is that it feels very relevant to the current events of 2020; so it may not be nearly as funny in five years or so. All in all; Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm is a worthy sequel of the original.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202644/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious and poignant at the same time,5,21,45,MazzyMayhem-117-544511,24 October 2020,Although this film is not as funny or shocking as the first Borat film; it is still thoroughly entertaining; shocking and full of the excruciating scenes one would expect from Borat. Sacha's writing and delivery are superb. I loved the addition of his daughter; played brilliantly by Maria B; although there was an element of poignancy with her character.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201479/?ref_=tt_urv
 Absolute Legend Sacha Baron Cohen,10,38,89,Beeornottobee,23 October 2020,This guy has the balls to pull of things like nobody else can

 Meh,10,39,92,devkell,23 October 2020,It was fine; but seeing all the great reviews make me want to review it less. What are you seeing that I'm not? I wish I could elaborate more; all I can say is that it's what I expected. A super commercialized version of borat.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197722/?ref_=tt_urv
 Give this man an oscar.,1,26,58,nikostsoup,24 October 2020,Borat 2 is as amazing as the first one and touches on some of America's political problems. Sacha Baron gives an amazing performance along with his "daughter" that is Golden Globe or even Oscar worthy. And thinking that he did it within a pandemic; pranking some of America's highest political figures without them knowing that they were being filmed for a movie; makes it much more fun.
Give this film a watch and you won't be disappointed. It's NIICE.
HIGH FIVE.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200416/?ref_=tt_urv
 Absolutely hilarious,6,14,28,jpmock,31 October 2020,Sacha does it again. I started the movie thinking this is going to be so silly stupid. It's actually really creative and had me crying laughing more than once.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6220393/?ref_=tt_urv
 Ignorant movie with a jokes in style of dumb and dumber,8,14,28,nikita1923666,25 October 2020,This movie is very dumb and anopropriate. Sasha himself is very ignorant person who makes fun of other cultures. I guess for most people it will be a bug shock but Kazakhstan where the main character is from is a real beautiful country. The way borat exposes it is very offensive. If you like jokes about pubes and period I guess this is a movie for you.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203759/?ref_=tt_urv

 We needed this.,10,18,38,Sleepin_Dragon,25 October 2020,Well done Sacha Baron Cohen; it's been many years since we last saw Borat torment all manner of people.I was keen to have a look what those in Kazakhstan thought of it; and it seems the reaction was a little different to the last movie. They perhaps realise now that this was perhaps a pop at an altogether more famous administration further West.Oh my days the Mike Pence speech; the rally; there were times when I was cringing; but you can't help laugh; the reactions are the best part. The scene with Rudy Giuliani is perhaps the moment where your jaw will drop to its lowest point.I thought Maria Bakalova was pretty terrific as Tutar.I've read some of the reviews; and I think people are missing the point; this is satire; we are absolutely crying out for satire; fun poked at everyone; particularly during this turbulent time.Shocking; but funny. 9/10.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205286/?ref_=tt_urv
 Baron Cohen kisses his reputation goodbye,9,11,21,samyoung-82648,25 October 2020,I'm not American. I'm not religious. In fact; in no way am I the target of this film. So why is this film so terrible? Because it fails on all counts.The first movie was clever because it took a mirror to society. It poked fun without being political; without preaching and telling people what to think. This film is not fun.This film is a thinly veiled "Republicans bad; Democrats good" and "zomg it's the patriarchy... you mean a girl has a brain?". I'm not American so the political parties mean nothing to me ... however; the message was not "a mirror on society"; it was a "mirror on Cohen's prejudices and inability to critically think".This film can be summed up in four letters. WOKE.If you absolutely detest Donald Trump and you love selling victimhood to women; you will absolutely love this film.This film is stale; extremely political and very shallow. Baron Cohen's reputation will suffer for this film. What a disappointment he's become. The first Borat film was fresh and amazing. This is the polar opposite.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206657/?ref_=tt_urv
 Really a masterpiece!,1,28,64,megustagameplay,24 October 2020,As a non-american user;I really liked the movie .
In its politically incorrect way of humor; Borat manages to destroy every certainty of every American and at the same time show the corrupt sides of the most glorious nation in the world.
The fact that the movie was shot during the election campaign made me even more happy.
A movie that unfortunately a lot of people will hate; thanks to its nature; but that many will understand over the time.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203217/?ref_=tt_urv
 Sacha Baron Cohen at his finest,8,31,72,seeawaymore,23 October 2020,Don't listen to all the 1/10 reviews. This movie is the opposite of being "anti-woman"; it seems a lot of people are missing the fact that you're not supposed to agree with Borat; but laugh at how the people of a supposedly more civilized country react to him.
I honestly it holds up decently compared to the first one; sure it has a lot more scripted scene and the storyline is more coherent; but the fact that SBC can still get those kind of reactions out of people years after he reached worldwide fame is honestly jawdropping.
Huge shoutout to Maria Bakalova; she was absolutely hilarious as Borat's daughter.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198332/?ref_=tt_urv
 I just didn't find it funny...,10,26,59,bnarysfun,23 October 2020,Sadly this is time I won't get back in my life. I went into watching this hoping for at least a few laughs but I couldn't muster even one. It felt very one-sided in who he's targeting (which is likely the point). After viewing this I likely won't be watching another Sasha Baron Cohen film.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200239/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious and vulgar!,1,13,26,santoshambekar19,24 October 2020,Borat - the character which will be remembered all the time and perhaps would have been thought over for why they did not make more out of it! This one really is a good sequel to its decade long release. Its vulgar and disgusting but yet very entertaining!
Wanna have more of this!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201404/?ref_=tt_urv
 If ur up for laughs this'll make you laugh 😂,8,19,41,jackelms,24 October 2020,Brilliant haven't seen a movie like this in a while
Had me laughing like crazy
A must watch with family
If u have a sense of humour you'll love this
It's better to laugh then wine about things
Enjoy life,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202040/?ref_=tt_urv
 Absolutely terrible!,8,17,36,walk-34180,25 October 2020,Was a big fan of Ali-G but after that Sasha has gone down hill. I watched with high hopes but honestly didn't laugh once from beginning to end. This movie is nothing more than a desperate attempt to defeat Trump with last minute votes and only uses mainstream media lies. It is very obvious to anyone with have a brain. But I'm sure liberals had a good laugh they have much lower standards and we're probably high while watching.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204497/?ref_=tt_urv
 Pre-Election Election,9,17,36,rnsm-12564,24 October 2020,A lot of offended republicans rated the movie with 1/10 still the movie made it to 7.2/10. I hope this is a forecast of the coming election.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202846/?ref_=tt_urv
 The baby scene alone was worth five stars,1,17,36,khmaps,24 October 2020,If you rated this movie less than five stars then you either didn't watch it or skipped straight to the Giuliani part.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200631/?ref_=tt_urv
 Loved it,1,15,31,edhart08,27 October 2020,A great and very funny/clever/ audacious follow -up to his previous Borat masterpieces. Poor old dumb the dumber Giuliani caught unaware and unprepared,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6210018/?ref_=tt_urv
 not funny,1,15,31,mjoyceh,25 October 2020,This demographic for this film seems to be 12-year-old boys. I did not find it to be in the least bit funny.Much of this film is extremely insulting towards women: women in cages; women menstruating; women's breasts; women being sold as property; etc. I got so fed up with all this; I didn't finish the film.The misogynism was bad enough. But adding insult to injury; the insults were not even funny. They just made me cringe.My favorite film genre is satire. But to be effective; satire has to be subtle: Broad enough to let viewers feel good about being in on the joke; but not so broad the film seems to be endorsing the very things it is supposedly lampooning. Sacha Cohen badly overstepped.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205345/?ref_=tt_urv
 Pure Trash,1,15,31,garydeanfabac,24 October 2020,Don't waste your time with this lowbrow mindless garbage.
.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203546/?ref_=tt_urv
 35 minutes of my life I will never get back,9,15,31,oroyer,24 October 2020,Yes; 35 minutes; that's when I stopped watching. I tried; I really tried because I believe to make an educated comment; one must go through the process.However I could not go through with it. it's pathetically idiotic; not funny; not even shocking; not really offensive.... it... it... it's just ... I have no words.Simply put; a complete waste of time and bandwidth.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202731/?ref_=tt_urv
 Terrible movie,10,15,31,w0507636,24 October 2020,About 3 minutes worth watching. 1.5hrs of wasted time.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202573/?ref_=tt_urv
 Great fun,10,7,12,akcooley-37302,3 November 2020,I really enjoyed this film; clever; hilarious and surprisingly heartwarming. If you liked the first movie you will certainly like the second.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6233790/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat is back to put the hotsie into the notsie,10,27,62,siris-96877,24 October 2020,Superb ; hilarious ; provocative ; a must see for all who wants Borat's assessment of the current political climate,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201785/?ref_=tt_urv
 Amazing execute, like he would say,7,22,49,carlossanchezlopez,25 October 2020,Borat and Maria; are amazing actors do not feel shame like the rest of us; which allows him to do some legendary hilarious and cringeworthy performances; while giving an important message at the same time.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204652/?ref_=tt_urv
 Loved it!,7,22,49,Rankkamustikka,24 October 2020,I went in expecting a few laughs; and I got much more. Having read some reviews that've been posted; I thought I'd weigh in my opinion.Sure the movie had some obvious staged scenes; but there were a lot of genuine reactions by innocent bystanders. For example; the dance scene at the ball was genuine; Michael Pence; the scene with Trump's lawyer; as well as the song at the rally.Some say the ending was rushed; but in my opinion; the ending tied the movie's plot VERY NICEly together. I had a hard time believing that Khazakhstan's president would send Borat on a mission as ridiculous as delivering a gift to Trump's second in line; just to get in the "big boys club".
So; for me; the ending made perfect sense.I'm entitled to my views; and everyone else to their own :),https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201202/?ref_=tt_urv
 Still sharp and hilarious,8,10,19,Sir_AmirSyarif,30 October 2020,Not as sharp and fresh as the original; but 'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm' is still sharp and very enjoyable nonetheless. It is a hilarious and brilliantly astute commentary on current events and the social and political landscape of America. Sacha Baron Cohen is still hilarious while Maria Bakalova steals the show.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6217997/?ref_=tt_urv
 Just what we needed,8,10,19,Stanlee107,28 October 2020,It has been a very difficult year; but this film is what we needed. I never expected this to be as funny as the first film.
Sacha Baron Cohen embodies Borat & he is great at eliciting scripted/genuine ignorance from the public. However; the performance from Maria Bakalova as his daughter Tutar that brings heart to this film. It is an enjoyable film & I would recommend this.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6214522/?ref_=tt_urv
 I thought Sacha had lost his touch, I was wrong Borat returns not as scandalous but with the same level of boldness,7,10,19,blackoutH,28 October 2020,The first time I saw the original Borat; I was too young to understand the comedic genius that this man actually is; having seen sometimes since then there's no question of how brilliant the Borat phenomenon is. Sacha is a fantastic actor and that associated with an incredible control not to go out of character and of course an insane dosage of courage; they dictate the quality of comedy of the movies and TV shows that Borat has appeared. The most important aspect of Borat in my opinion is not the outrageous lengths that the character goes for the laughs; but rather the intelligent and defenetely not subtle criticism of all that is wrong in our society.
For those not familiar; Sacha has had several comedic characters throughout his career; they are usually exaggerated caricatures of individuals; and they have the goal of showing that not only these are indeed ridiculous stereotypes but also at the same time exposing the discrimination; racism and hypocrisy of the people that interact with him.Sacha has been doing this for a long time; and since gaining worldwide recognition with the first Borat movie he has been kind of in the shadows; except with his TV show "Who is America" who should have had way more recognition than it should; exposing the rotten that infects the American regime and government.
And now he makes the comeback 14 years later with another approach for the infamous journalist from Kazakhstan - I am not going to lie;I was hesitant when I first heard about it; because the first movie and the previous TV appearances were so good and sometimes you shouldn't mess with what was already a brilliant piece of work; but turns out that he still got it!I think that overall you get a similar approach and formula with some fresh perspective; this time Borat has his daughter with him ready to make you uncomfortable again with the typical blunt and outrageous ideas that we are now used to at this point. I believe that the movie might not be as scandalous as the previous movie or even at the level of the "Who is America" TV show; for which to this day I am still shocked; but maybe that feeling might be because I've seen how far he went on other occasions; so we still get some very sad and socking attitudes coming from America; and although this is a comedy you should look at it with a critical eye as well; this is the best "it's funny because it's true" type of scenario that you can get.
It has been released on a critical time in the US; I do have some strong opinions on what is going on; but I won't get deep into them I'll just encourage everybody to watch the movie; it's as insightful as it is funny,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213682/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat's return!,10,10,19,mateusolivotti,28 October 2020,Okay; the first Borat was controversial; sparked some processes; but its 2020 sequence will likely have many; many more processes. Without a doubt Sacha Baron Cohen is a brave person.
14 years after the events of the first film Borat is sent back to the United States; but this time with a different purpose and alongside his daughter.
We waited 14 years for a sequel to the first feature; and was it worth it?
the answer is yes! It was very worth it
Borat 2020 presents the same kind of humor as the first film which is great; again a very good performance by Sacha Baron Cohen and most importantly: extremely heavy criticisms of the American lifestyle and the Trump administration; which is undoubtedly the point highest in the film.
Perhaps anyone who is not fully familiar with current US policy will not understand one or the other joke; but you can have fun just the same.
At certain moments in the film you will find yourself asking: What is this? How hasn't Sacha Baron Cohen been arrested yet ??
And this is just amazing.
But obviously not everything in the film is wonderful; it presents some problems of the first film; as things are resolved very easily and happen very fast; for me the first Borat (2007) is still better; but the second feature manages to honor the first well.
Borad (2020) is a great film; even though it is not perfect and a little inferior than the first; it is a great sequel and a very funny comedy film; with heavy criticisms and pertinent to the USA,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213626/?ref_=tt_urv
 To the point,1,10,19,kosmasp,28 October 2020,As far as I remember; this seems more focused than the first Borat movie. Though I have to admit; I have to rewatch the previous entry in the Borat world. Some things almost seem improbable (like what did he tell people; that they would actually not just go along with some of th stuff but also say really despicably things?); others may seem devious to say the least.One of the biggest things of the movie is the Rudy Giuliani story. Tucking in your shirt becomes a whole new issue ... now whether you believe him or not (the whole thing should make you feel like a creepy voyeur); Rudy has been; said and done worse as what we actually see in the movie. But since Sascha Baron Cohen could not see exactly what was happening; he may have (coitus) interrupted a bit too quick - for those who are still not convinced what was going on ... or rather what was about to happen.Generally speaking you should not be easily offended. And while there are blows to almost everything and everyone; it is mostly the ridiculous Trump cult that will be outraged the most - snowflakes and all that. Of course if you are a fan of his; you already gave me a negative feedback - I can live with that. I hope I don't have to live with more Potus Trump any longer ...,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213234/?ref_=tt_urv
 LOLOLOL,9,18,39,mhuseman-20255,24 October 2020,I loved this movie! I am a Trump fan but I do have a sense of humor & I gave this a 10! I've been watching scary movies for the last 2 weeks so it was a change to watch a comedy. I watched by myself and literally laughed OUT LOUD at least every 5-10 minutes!. I love Sacha Baron Cohen and Maria Bakalova was excellent in her role. They had me in tears I was laughing so hard. I needed a great comedy to watch and it's hard to find one that keeps my attention; I will be watching again for a nonstop LOLfest! Thank you for making this for us especially at a time where we could all use cracking up in a good way!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200506/?ref_=tt_urv
 Cruel, nasty and crude..... and not funny,10,16,34,cordenw,25 October 2020,Sometimes you can get away with parodies of third world countries. Monty Python did it very well in a couple of their films and sketches but they were never cruel in making dupes out of their own leaders or members of their own society.I've seen a few of Cohen's movies now; and apart from Talladega Nights they've been duds ; to me he's just not funny.By setting up honest but naïve patsies for his jokes he is more of a predator than a comedian and I'm sorry; but it's hard to laugh at someone being just plain cruel to someone else.He knows what he's got to do to get shock value and doesn't have any restraint in using anything that comes into his head ..... it's not funny; its just cheap; kinda like Will Farrell uses severed arms and legs in his empty scenes.It's the same old story... have a lucky hit with the first one and you must be a genius. So you're given the keys to the store and allowed to do what you like on the next project; which is based on the formula of the first one.It doesn't really matter that the first one was only mildly funny scriptwise and depended upon those shock scenes; these geniuses that give the go ahead think that lightning can strike twice.We all know how easily the shock factor wears off and to me ; in this version; it didn't even reach the level of parody.I really can't see anybody sitting through this piece of garbage for the full hour and a half or so. Negotiate a fifty percent reduction in price before you go in or ask for a discount on your prime membership.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204403/?ref_=tt_urv
 Better than the original,8,16,34,indiedavid,24 October 2020,Disregard the negative reviews. They are all from Republicans or uptight prudes (also Republicans). There is nothing in the trailer or Cohen's history that leads you to believe that this is a wholesome family film. It is exactly what we come to expect from Cohen's brilliant docu-comedies; a sophomoric and hilarious satire on the many flaws of American society and he has a LOT of material to work with.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201581/?ref_=tt_urv
 Back like he never left!!!,10,16,34,mikelmyers-52063,24 October 2020,For almost 2 hours I forgot it was 2020 and the world felt like a better place. This movie was so entertaining!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200617/?ref_=tt_urv
 Great film,9,12,24,wilhelmdanielg,26 October 2020,Even better than the first movie; and extremely relevant to current events. Great acting; and lots of original humour.Without a doubt; anyone who gives this a bad rating (or downvotes this comment) was simply offended at how stupid it made them; or the people like them look. Bring in the cringey trump supporters who can't take a joke.SBC has always obviously been left leaning; and if that offends you; there's a good chance you won't like this film.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6209291/?ref_=tt_urv
 Sacha is a genius!!!!!!,10,12,24,sergfborges,26 October 2020,His follow-up is insanity... how does he get away with it!!!🤣🤣. Phenomenal comedy!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208010/?ref_=tt_urv
 Where Angels Fear to Tread,10,21,47,mattlayne,24 October 2020,From a "faith-based" Women's Clinic to Georgia debutante ball; Borat goes where few journalists dare and exposes our not so hidden hypocrisy in the process. I laughed. I cringed. I saw Rudy Guliani expose himself for the creep he is.
Thank you; Sacha Baron Cohen. By the way; is it true that Melania named her son after you?,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202128/?ref_=tt_urv
 Funny and very scary,7,21,47,avndragon,24 October 2020,Sasha is giving us a few laughs and some serious warnings if you can see beneath the humor. This movie should be seen by everyone in the world and a wake up call to people.
Sasha is wide awake in a world full of sleeping sheep. This movie is full of TRUTH. But the Truth can be scary if you know where the world is heading.
Look below the fake comedic facade for the scary truth.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202098/?ref_=tt_urv
 Too funny,10,14,29,briant2,27 October 2020,Borat and his daughter are hilarious. Satire for sure. Love the fat suit and the disguise,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6209746/?ref_=tt_urv
 Would Watch Again,8,14,29,JacobsReviews,24 October 2020,What worked:Sacha Baron Cohen is at it again in his subsequent moviefilm. Cohen; playing Kazakhstan journalist Borat must travel back to America and offer a gift to President Trump to make up for embarrassing Kazakhstan in the first Borat movie.There were a lot of hilarious scenes from Borat visiting a religious doctor's office asking the doctor to take out his daughter's 'baby'; to Borat bursting into CPAC and the Rudy Giuliani scene.If you want a good laugh; I can't think of anything better right now.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202160/?ref_=tt_urv
 Damn...Even better than first one!,10,14,29,mudokins4,24 October 2020,I wasn't a Borat fan; but the second part is better than the first part! Politicians in America should learn something from this movie!
I give 10 stars to the movie!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201434/?ref_=tt_urv
 Making America Grate Again...,8,22,50,Xstal,23 October 2020,... and for all the right reasons. Some genuinely laugh out loud moments leave you under no illusion just how talented Sacha Baron Cohen is as he ridicules some particularly odious and obnoxious characters; cultures; traditions and beliefs. With outstanding support from Maria Bakalova; you might be surprised how immune you've become to fascism in the land of the free but at least you'll do it with tears streaming down the side of your face and; quite possibly; a blub or two as the satire and mockery is gradually absorbed and starts to sink in.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198712/?ref_=tt_urv
 Yakshimash!!,8,17,37,mogsy-54031,24 October 2020,I really liked this film; I laughed non stop all the way through. I love the first movie and would say this is as funny if not funnier. Definitely something to watch if you just want to have a good laugh; and who doesn't need that after the year we've had so far. 10 out of 10 in my books 👍🏼,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202148/?ref_=tt_urv
 A Fool Never Learns,10,17,37,jadepietro,24 October 2020,GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Funny and biting satire about American values; handled adroitly by Mr. Cohen and company.JIM'S REVIEW: Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is a long clumsy title for a long clumsy but very entertaining movie. This mockumentary is a comedy of errors with many of its naive targets being right-wing nuts or staunch conservatives. The liberal sanction of our nation are spared any criticism or folly. Were the film more balanced; the end result would have been more uproarious in its biting satire of this country's polarity and skewed American values. Let's face it; there are good fools on both sides!Once again; Sasha Baron Cohan revives his most famous personality; Borat Sagdiyev; a fictional newscaster who creates havoc wherever he goes. This time around; 14 years later; the plot is not so scattershot and crude. The sequel concentrates on a father-daughter relationship and has many sweet and humorous transitional scenes between Borat and his 15 year-old teenager; Tutar; a Bulgarian actress in her early 20's named Maria Bakalova. (More on her later.) The plot centers around his mission to gift his daughter to Vice President Mike Pence as a present from his country; Kazakhstan. Of course; there will be many detours and obstacles along the way.Some set pieces work better than others. There is a very funny segment at a Southern debutant's ball that can be be quite offensive depending on your level of humor as the hi-jinks may stretch the level of good taste for some moviegoers. (This reviewer found it laugh-out-loud hilarious.) A public sing-along at a Trump rally where supporters sing out bigoted remarks that reek of white supremacy and a visit to a woman's clinic also zings with its pious righteousness. Other pranks fall flat like a trip to a barber; a visit to a synagog questioning the reality of the Jewish Holocaust; an overnight sleepover with QAnon conspiracy theorists; and the aforementioned Mike Pence daughter giveaway at a CPAC rally.Perhaps the major set piece and most controversial section of the movie is a unpleasant scene involving Rudi Giuliani in an interview that leads to his hotel bedroom with the young Tutar. The politician is already spinning his story in his fall from grace; but the visuals more than prove his deviant intent in an interview gone terribly wrong. His hypocrisy and sexual demeanor remains highly questionable in his Candid Camera moment...one he cannot undo that easily.Still one continually questions the gullibility of many of the peoples' idiocy; but there it is front and center for all to see: A baker; supporting her First Amendment rights; casually writes her anti-Semitic message in the best of cursive icing. A wealthy father comments on the $500 price tag of sex trafficking with his own daughter in earshot range. A pastor decries an abortion even though he learns it may have occurred through incest. One questions the scandalous commonality of these encounters. Despite a camera and film crew and seeing Mr. Cohen's obvious outrageous disguises; these saps easily become pawns in his attempts to prank them. And; for the most part; Mr. Cohen succeeds in mocking their abhorrent behaviors. This movie thrives on its politically incorrectness and shock value as its original source did in 2006; although its humor is not as mean-spirited or sexually charged as before.Abetting Mr. Cohen's political showmanship is some deft direction by Jason Wollner in his film debut and a literate screenplay that boasts a beguiling comic relationship that is inane and lovable by its leads. Ms. Bakalova is charming as the Melania wannabe and the actress has some nice comic timing; not to mention; courage to be put in some of these awkward situations; She is a strong counterbalance to the buffoonish Borat; played to imperfection by Mr. Cohan. This comedian has created an iconic and zany Everyman and his farcical instincts are still spot-on. He is unafraid to tackle contemporary political issues ranging from the Coronavirus to America's fascination with hate rhetoric. This film is on par with the inventive hit-and-miss rapid-fire comedies that are reminiscent of the slapstick satires from long ago; films in the tradition of the Marx Brothers; Mel and Albert Brooks; Christopher Guest; and some early Woody Allen gems.Sometimes subtle in his indignation of our American way of life; but mostly shamelessly excessive in his political skewering; Mr. Cohen latest absurdist comedy; Borat Subsequent Moviefilm; delivers his message with real flair.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201933/?ref_=tt_urv
 No Worry, Only 15 Cases! We Got This,2,17,37,thesar-2,24 October 2020,Welcome back; Borat. We needed you.I am review Borat Subsequent Moviefilm a/k/a Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan or Borat 2: Electric Boogaloo (that last one may or may not be true. YOU decide!) for your enjoyment and subtle liberal bias. Buckle up those buckles now.In October; I really only like watch horror movie in celebration of Most Wonderful Time of Year: All Hallows' Eve! But I make decision and watch world-premiere of Borat's Next Adventure. Not in Space; though that would be NICE! No; to VERY scary parts of U. S. of A. with conspiracy-theory-ists so in sense; this is Horror! Hur-rah!Me not think this would ever replace or match his original adventure to save his country; but dang it; it was SUPER close. I did find myself laughing at throughout and wow; I don't think crazy conspiracy-theory-ists are gonna rate this high.Borat must prove worth to country he help destroy in-between moving-pictures and must gift farm-house daughter to sexy-time Michael Pence or Borat might be execute! Oh; no; we don't want that. Not Nice!Will the number two kiss ass take lovely daughter as mate or will Borat learn more about meaning of dadhood? Or will hoax spread over country infect his brain to mush and ooze out ears for days? See? Might be horror.Also; might be fake. Not sure. It was hard to keep up with scenes if fake or real or real and fake. No worry. Evil still exist and we must vote to save Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan's newest sister country: Trump's America!***Final thoughts: Not sure how well I did up there. I thought pretty good. And here go more people dropping off my friend list. Bye-bye!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200964/?ref_=tt_urv
 WawaWewoah! The sequence is a great success! Funny scenes 😂 with well structured storyline.,8,9,17,pageadam-18523,26 October 2020,Borat does what he does the best that is messing with the culture of extreme black and white. The upside of this movie over the previous one is it's story which follows proper order in the midst of all the commotions. Borat's daughter adds additional entertaining performance to Sacha Baron incredible comic relief. Nothing could be better to relieve stress than Borat in covid 19 era...lol,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207740/?ref_=tt_urv
 It was funny in 2006,10,9,17,hesterjd-72853,26 October 2020,I tried to like it; but SBC hit a wall a long time ago.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207229/?ref_=tt_urv
 Impressive execution and some crude laughs,10,9,17,jackgdemoss,24 October 2020,Borat 2 was laugh out loud funny at times; but certainly not enough to warrant an 8/10. The story actually had some coherence rather than feeling like a prank show and even had some solid emotion; but that still can't account for its 8/10 status. What drove it up for me was how expertly executed these secret filmings must have been. Sure everyone has to sign a release to show their face in the film afterwards; but to corner some people to the point that they want/need to is mind boggling. As far as films that have a number one goal of shoving a political message in my face; this has to be my favorite.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203329/?ref_=tt_urv
 An intelligent comedic representation of much that is terrible in the US,10,23,53,kylecsparks,24 October 2020,The sequel to Borat - Borat Subsequent Moviefilm - is extremely clever; and definitely funny at times. This film once again proves that Sacha Baron Cohen is one of the most successful comedians who can expose the most misguided (or utterly repugnant) corners of America. Yes; this is a comedy; yes it is extreme and vulgar at times; but there are so many truths in this film. Definitely makes one step back and think about what parts of America are like. RUDY GIULIANI- I think got a little of what he deserves; given that he is a snake and a repulsive old man.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202165/?ref_=tt_urv
 Squirm through it - it's a must see!,9,15,32,rachelerceg,24 October 2020,It's uncomfortable; laughable; maddening and it is heartbreaking.Borat returns 14 years after exposing the dark underbelly of our country only to discover that it's no longer hidden beneath the surface. This film exposes a level of racism; bigotry and stupidity that have become commonplace.But however disturbing (and it really is incredibly sickening) much of the film is to watch; Borat (Sasha Baron Cohen) and Tutor (Maria Bakalova) manage to create a thread of hope throughout the film.This was unlike the first Borat. But in 2020 it had to be. Watch this.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200980/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious, Genius,9,15,32,bobhog-78892,24 October 2020,In these awful times; just what we needed. Genius; Sasha.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200866/?ref_=tt_urv
 At least as good as the original,9,15,32,atcaines,24 October 2020,Consistent laughs; great movie. A master of making people say stupid things,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200520/?ref_=tt_urv
 Sacha doing what he does best.,9,13,27,jonbrownnz,24 October 2020,While the film was a lil short and rushed; it was still a good delivery despite the circumstances that they had making it. Brilliantly trolling and making the petals cry.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201782/?ref_=tt_urv

 Sacha cohen did it again,1,18,40,mordesign-90274,24 October 2020,Thank you sacha for showing the bigotry and the nice people as well of this country; this was a great movie and if you can't watch this with an open mind you are missing out; keep doing what you do man.

 Lefty Rubbish,4,21,48,neilp-49818,24 October 2020,This is so poor compared to the first one! A sour lefty pushing his agenda against Trump. Should have stuck to Ali G; and retired. Let your wife- who has talent earn the money!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203179/?ref_=tt_urv

 Worse than Grimsby,9,21,48,llamasite,23 October 2020,I am a long time fan of Sacha Baron Cohen; and eagerly anticipated a sequel to one of the funniest films ever made; Borat. Unfortunately; this is probably his worst work yet; and along with his comic genius; he has produced a few clangers. This is the worst yet.Unfortunately; almost everything is painfully staged; and the few candid moments; would have been left on the cutting room floor; had there been anything else to string the film together.
Newcomer Maria Bakalova does her best; and manages to drive the very few and far between candid and humorous moments in the film.This sequel should not have been made.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198582/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not as good as the original.,1,5,8,FilmRevFew,3 November 2020,Unfortunately it's hard for SBC to be Borat in public; as it's evident he is recognised everywhere; this is made clear very early on.
SBC playing Borat playing someone else; is a level of genius; however doesn't enable the raw outrageous antics of Borat Sagdiyev.
A lot of effort was put into this; it's clear; and the same disruptive pranks are followed throughout.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6232037/?ref_=tt_urv
 Topical and bone chilling,10,30,73,tgainey14,23 October 2020,Its most of what you would expect. Hilarious; uncomfortable; and mostly shocking. If im being honest it reminds me more of "Who Is America" but I was a big fan. If you like seeing the real side of people; then I'd definitely check this out. Even if you don't like what you see.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198051/?ref_=tt_urv
 Horrible,8,16,35,Exorcistus,24 October 2020,Was happy when I found out that a new Borat movie was released.Unfortunately this is very far from comedy. Didn't laugh even once. All I see is leftist political activism. Sasha Cohen has unfortunately disappointed with this one.This was more like Who is America part 2.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203455/?ref_=tt_urv
 Over-the-Top Hilarious,8,16,35,TimMath-545-333580,24 October 2020,This movie is a gut punch to the fringe (or now mainstream?) right-wing. It is Borat's fearless; vulgar take down of American ignorance. Some fans are disappointed that the movie is too overtly political; with targets like QANON and MAGA; how can Cohen resist? The most sympathetic; endearing characters in the film are the real-life Black and Jewish women who try to save the misguided Borat and his show-stealing "daughter." This is a movie that shocks the system; but that is why it is precisely right for the time. WARNING: If you support the idea that Democrats drink baby blood; this might not be the movie for you.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202350/?ref_=tt_urv
 Bold! Unapologetic! Hilarious!,10,19,43,shkamath-01355,24 October 2020,It's fascinating to me how Sacha Baron Cohen writes & acts in such mockumentaries than when he is in a drama. The sheer range of this man is absolutely amazing. "Borat" took everybody by surprise for its narrative and "Subsequent MovieFilm" raises the bar and ends on a warm; touching note. It is hilarious from the get-go; all the punches land & obviously SBC doesn't pull his punches back. Some scenes are uncomfortable yet hilarious. Loved Maria Bakalova! Her chemistry with SBC is fabulous. The social commentary was a big addition to the political conversation. Loved everything about the movie and I'm sure I can watch it multiple times!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201544/?ref_=tt_urv
 Excellent addition to the Borat franchise,1,19,43,mnhertz26-818-895128,24 October 2020,It's often hard for a sequel to live up to the original; but this came pretty darn close. The daughter was a very smart twist that differentiated it from the original. Also considering that it was filmed during COVID; I'm very pleased with the outcome.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201029/?ref_=tt_urv
 Genius,9,28,68,Dal_Cyrus,23 October 2020,The only low scores will be from upset redneck and Mcdonald Trump fans. They are shown up for the gullible idiots they are by Sacha and how he brings covid into the story as it happened live and surely altered the ending he had oringally planned is just pure genius.The first was funnier; this one is more important.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198483/?ref_=tt_urv
 SBC proves again he is vulgar and disgusting,9,14,30,cooperonline-60439,25 October 2020,Lenny Bruce pushed the limits in his day by cursing; SBC does it by splashing lewd and disgusting imagery into your face. This is not comedy. It is offensive no matter what your politics.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206673/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat: The Next Generation!,9,14,30,NathanielBacon,24 October 2020,Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm is great! It manages to recreate the bizarre tone and vibrancy of the first film and updates the story to feel very 2020 with some excellent satire; social commentary and several standout hilarious segments. Sacha Baron Cohen is still not afraid to offend you and remains excellent at doing so. Maria Bakalova is an instant comedy star as his daughter Tutar (truly a new icon of the genre). I will never forget the fertility dance; as long as I live. 🤣 There's also a bit of unexpected character depth and pathos which I didn't expect from this movie. This unlikely father-daughter story just works. 👏,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202613/?ref_=tt_urv
 Wawa wee wa, very nice !!,10,14,30,devinderbonding,24 October 2020,Loved it; Borat is back -- and how !! More irreverent and politically incorrect than ever. I haven't laughed this hard in a while. Thank you S.B.Cohen for giving us something to laugh our heads off; in this time of gloom.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202569/?ref_=tt_urv
 Flipping brilliant,8,14,30,jill-395,24 October 2020,Just what we need in these dark times; something to lighten the mood with some belly laughs. The actress that plays his daughter is amazing; as it the guy at the fax shop. As always; shines a light on the farce that is america and its politics at the moment. Let's hope Borat is the saviour that can sort things out.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202007/?ref_=tt_urv
 Genius political satire!,10,14,30,mywordsdidglow,24 October 2020,The phrase; "Give em enough rope to hang themselves"; was never more true! At times hilarious; at times disturbing; never boring. SBC does a good job of showing some people who were genuinely kind and compassionate as well; which restores a certain degree of faith in the US of A. Even; at times; some of those who he is lampooning are portrayed with a degree of humanity; not just caricatures. They are shown as misinformed; yet caring and hard-working. The actions of Rudy G; the gold-digger; and others; however; speak for themselves. TBH; If you have more than one Trump sign in your yard and need your daily Sean Hannity fix; you will probably hate it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201766/?ref_=tt_urv
 Just what US and A needs right now,10,14,30,TheSilverStreak,24 October 2020,Yes; it's heavily political. Yes; some scenes will shock you. But considering we're days away from what may be the most important election of our lives; I believe this is a great tool to remind us of some of the horrible things going on of which we have become desensitized. Watch it asap!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201705/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious,10,14,30,jwdb-11864,24 October 2020,I had a great time watching this. I would definitely recommend this to you.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201090/?ref_=tt_urv
 If you would of told me 20 yrs ago that Ali G creator would make a good movie inn 2020 I would of said no way,9,14,30,thatleoguy,24 October 2020,This movie is a work of art in a politically tenseful time. It can potentially trigger both Democrats and Republicans . Expected for 2 sensitive groups that only see each other as red and blue.The movie itself flows really good. The skits are hard to tell if real or not . But after reading more info on the actors ; there's no way you could of wrote that type of material . It flowed too natural out of those people's mouth's for not being actors . A lot of organic humors momentsVery good movie. Not as offensive as the first one but still good enough to stand on it's own. I hope he makes tons of cash off it .,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200949/?ref_=tt_urv
 Great follow up to the first film!,7,14,30,jamesthompson2008,23 October 2020,Sequels never fare too well and beating the original without being too repetitive must have been a huge challenge but the addition to Borats story and the star of the show is the extremely likeable Daughter Tutar: Maria Bakalova is fantastic and she carrys the Sagdiyev baton and racing to the finish line with it.There are the usual staged pieces; plot devices and setups here; though surprisingly not as much as people might believe but this time the story is stronger than it was before and scenes don't feel too forced or dragged on for too long leaving to the inevitable cringe overload.The dedication to the Borat character is still real as ever and although its not always possible to have SBC in the Borat character - for example when he is in various disguises he did sometimes slip up and drop his accent in favour of a more American one - which for Borat shouldn't seem plausible or true to form but it never felt like it got in the way too much of the plot as long as it was for the sake of fooling the right people.The bits where he is in character though are fantastic and the scripting; editing and camera work feels more like a proper film this time round and ends up doing it even more justice so much that you often forget that it's candid. I often forgot all about the cameras which both amazes and stuns you when you do realise just how clever it was to setup and to produce.Some might find this less intense or filled with as many stunts as the original and with it being more plot driven; people might feel that it's taking time away from Borats usual escapades but the story is what makes the difference this time along with the little touches and shows of emotion.The mix of those and these little moments of crazyness of reality are what gel this film together as a well rounded if not slightly cut short SBC masterpiece.Oh and it's hilarious. Some of the funniest scenes that you will never see in another movie ever hilarious.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200415/?ref_=tt_urv
 Funny and needed in these times,1,14,30,harveyjohnuk,23 October 2020,Brilliant funny heart warming current virus times .,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200219/?ref_=tt_urv
 Please watch him or Borat will be executed,1,8,15,WolfieLol,25 October 2020,Borat 2 suprasses expectations; it might be not as good as the first one (which is a masterpiece) but for the laughs and the criticism it truly worth the wait
This film had arrived in such an aproppiate time that is unbelieveable; makes fun of Trump; Coronavirus and much more on a unique way that only our lord Sacha Baron Cohen could handle; and shows in this film his extraordinary talent not only because of his comic power (And method acting) but for being the kind of activist that we need right now; not the stupid type of activism who focus on victimism; but a comic and funny activism who searches for showing us the true colors of American Society without any political correction.
Also Maria did an amazing job portraying Borat´s daughter; she steals the scenes a lot of time and i hope for her to have a great future on acting
Another thing i personally liked is the evolution of the plot; the first Borat film was just a road movie; this one instead is a complicated plot full of conflicts and problems and most of all the Cringe-Heartwarming evolution between Borat and his daughterUnfortunately unlike its predecessor; Borat Subsequent Moviefilm; just focus the main attack on the Republican Party a few months before elections; which is sad and dull because the first one makes fun about all types of North American; and what we really needed as an audience is variety of laughs and weird types of American people to make fun of.
Also another thing that i disliked (besides some weird montage) It´s probably how rushed the experience felt; i know this film was made in secret but even in that way I wanted more Borat; more Jokes more everything; but it felt really short like a synopsis of the film instead of the actual film.But even with those problems; a really wonderful film to watch and laugh; truly the film we needed during this times,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203975/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not a true Borat sequel,1,3,4,decarloj,9 November 2020,This movie has nothing to do with the first film; it's just election year propaganda.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6248670/?ref_=tt_urv
 Disappointing,6,3,4,pweber_a,9 November 2020,Very sad about seeing a movie made just for politics reasons. And it was no funny at all.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6248449/?ref_=tt_urv
 95 minutes of my life wasted,7,3,4,leerevell-69549,8 November 2020,The worst film; if that's what you can call it; I've ever seen. Didn't laugh once and was clearly paid for by Amazon to have a poke at Trump supporters and Trump before the election.
Another example of how low the Elite will stop to try and fool the public. How wrong they wereSasha should be ashamed for this political stunt for money,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6246630/?ref_=tt_urv
 Some fun,7,3,4,gamerz-18042,7 November 2020,Not as good as first. Still decent albeit nauseating at times.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6244647/?ref_=tt_urv
 Some really funny moments but not as great as the first one,1,3,4,vithiet,3 November 2020,This is definitely in line with the spirit of the first movie but it does give off a vibe of "recycled material". There are definitely some funny moments but some of them felt very scripted; after looking into it a bit more; it's been confirmed some of them were staged (not all of them though) and that is also taking away some of the charm. Still a pretty funny comedy overall if like me you like this type of humor.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6233355/?ref_=tt_urv
 More mature, less funny,2,3,4,eagandersongil,2 November 2020,"Borat 2" is a film much more mature and aware of what it wants to do than its predecessor; we even have a very well constructed social criticism; with characters who suffer from ailments and have doubts about their development and personality; everything is very well explored behind a curtain of a black; slapstick and absurd mood but that still works very well; it works out that "Borat 1" is funnier; but the sequence has its moments.It would be difficult to imagine borat nowadays; a film that has a humorous charge that today is not so well socially accepted; the solution was to satirize the right people so as not to suffer from severe criticism or boycotts; a wise move to build narrative.The film has a simple but effective direction; many loose cameras; use of natural lighting; with extremely organic short shots; although the film does not feel the same shockumentary as the first; its transgression still works. the actors look great; Sacha Baron delivers a convincing and fun borat and bilak sagdiyev surprises with a multi-layered performance."Borat 2" is a fun movie; with an acid; mature script and that even has several Plots; with a great conclusion; here we have a bunch of ideas that are organized and that work very differently from the first; even if the sequence has less charm; it is still an interesting film and that preaches a humor that is needed nowadays. 7/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6230785/?ref_=tt_urv
 Very bad,2,12,25,snottydyck,26 October 2020,I was a big fan of the first Borat movie but this one is just embarrassing. Tries too hard to slag republicans and fails huge. Don't bother wasting an hour and a half.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207188/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not anywhere as good as the first Borat film!,7,12,25,leedan91,25 October 2020,I was excited to watch this movie; especially seeing all the hype and trailers circulating online. But this second edition was not as funny or original. It was actually kind of mean spirited. Some parts were pretty cringeworthy of how bad the setup was.Rudy Giuliani part was a pretty good gotcha.the film targeted a women's group who were very supportive of the actress even though they were being duped; that was really cringe.the scene where borat sings "Whatcha gonna do" at the outdoor trump rally was pretty funny.the scene at the women's clinic was too contrivedthe two guys explaining the clintons drank blood was funny.why you dupe every single group but don't dupe the ladies in the synagogue? How come no crass parts there? That was super weak.I can see how people who vote republican would view this movie as very biased.Overall; this is a pretty boring movie; not a lot of laughs. The first movie was so funny; the second movie was pretty boring...,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204267/?ref_=tt_urv
 Sasha...Sasha...,9,12,25,ruicunha-22532,24 October 2020,So my favourite character of all time; as with all the rest on this sick times; was brought back to life simply to destroy Trump and make him look bad. Borat too; had to become political. You can't make this s**t up. Needless to Stay; not a single political scene is funny. Only when borat is being the old borat; free of "wokeness"; makes you laugh. I'm such a huge huge fan of borat...I can't believe Sasha Baron Cohen did this to us. I mean...really Unforgivable. The guy is completly blind in his hate for Trump.Shame on you Sasha!Boy am i disappointed...,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202513/?ref_=tt_urv
 Nowhere near as good as its predecessor but still a good sequel,2,12,25,ronakkotian,24 October 2020,I love Borat. I remember seeing the first film and thinking it was the funniest film I've ever seen so naturally I was excited for the sequel. It's nowhere near as good as the first film but I still enjoyed it.Borat Subsequent Moviefilm shows Borat fourteen years later after the success of the first film where he has to gift his daughter to Vice President Mike Pence.It came as a shock to me when it was announced that Borat 2 has already been shot; edited and shown to various people. As a huge fan of Borat I got excited but knew deep inside that it wasn't gonna come close to the first film and I was correct. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm doesn't match the hilarity of its predecessor but at the same time I still laughed a pretty good amount during this film. There are still some very funny and shocking gags and; like the first film; there is a lot of political and social commentary that makes America seem really bad but what I didn't expect was how emotional the film was going to be. Aside from the jokes and commentary; this is really a father-daughter story which some people may not like if they're going into this movie expecting a ton of funny pranks. The father-daughter story does have its heartfelt moments and builds on both characters and creates arcs for them but the structure is really predictable and cliché.After viewing the trailer; I was really worried about the daughter character but I feel Maria Bakalova really stood out in this film. She really surprised me at how great she was and her ability to keep up with Cohen is commendable. Once again; Sacha Baron Cohen nails Borat and it feels VERY NICE to see him back in the role. Both of them have a strong dynamic with each other and that helped massively during the more heartfelt scenes.It's great how relevant this film is right now but if I were to see it again a few years down the line; the film may feel outdated. I don't think the film's topics like COVID-19 will hold up as well as it does now. What I loved about the first film was its timeless nature and that's why I'm still able to enjoy it no matter how many times I've seen it.I have my issues with Borat Subsequent Moviefilm but above all; I still had a great time watching it and I think it's one of the better sequels I've seen. It doesn't have as much replay value as its predecessor but I wouldn't mind seeing it again.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202100/?ref_=tt_urv
 Edgy and hilarious,2,12,25,justinblack-17433,24 October 2020,Pushes the boundaries and sometimes leaps over the line. But after the initial gut reaction I found myself in stitches. Haven't laughed that hard in a while.Sends a message; tells a story; and somehow accomplishes both merged into one. The plot line makes you ask what could be possible and what is too absurd to be believable only to realize that every single event is exists.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201063/?ref_=tt_urv
 Infantile and for those with very low IQ's,9,21,49,Hopedoesnotdie,24 October 2020,Really dumb; their bad acting and fake gibberish language was not only lazy but annoying to my ears. Also it's ironic he shows the video of Trump calling women hot; when I haven't met a single straight man (even liberals and Hillary supporters) resist calling a woman hot or talking about women with desire. It's human nature and any woman who thinks her boyfriend hasn't objectified women is not only naive but probably a mentally impaired feminist.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200487/?ref_=tt_urv
 Boring,10,10,20,darksideofmoon,25 October 2020,What a dissapointment! You can only stretch a joke to a certain degree and then it becomes unbearable. This is just a rehash of old film but more daft and ridiculous. Unwatchable and totally avoidable. Watch the first film again instead; and it will be more enjoyable than this junk.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204560/?ref_=tt_urv
 You need to watch this film TWICE!,5,10,20,driziti,24 October 2020,Cohen is amazing. He knows exactly how to build enough intrigue with these marks. He capitalises on their curiosity ultimately leading to their being the butt of the joke. And who can feel sorry for them When you're laughing your behind off?The ending will make you smile.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200558/?ref_=tt_urv

 I was looking forward to watch this movie,10,15,33,nkishudak,23 October 2020,I loved the first one; and in generally SBH works. This one is too staged; not that funny. Disappointing.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198693/?ref_=tt_urv
 Okay, some good spots.,8,16,36,James_TheMan,23 October 2020,There area few good laughs in this; the best being a dance. If you don't like rednecks and southerners much; you will like this. Though I think they have been unfairly treated here; cherry picked you could say.Hard to tell who was real and who was acting in some cases.
The actor playing his daughter did a good job.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198318/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,10,17,39,Jo_Blo_Movie_Critic,24 October 2020,9/10 - hysterical; timely; and quite revealing sequel to the 2006 original will certainly be one to look back on in a few years,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201296/?ref_=tt_urv
 Just brilliant,2,29,73,garethwhite-88221,23 October 2020,Outstanding from start to finish; Maria Bakalova deserves an award; that girl has got crazy talent. Borot hasn't missed a beat. When Americans do unbelievably stupid thing he's there to just shine a mirror at them. Excellent work.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198435/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat is more than a comedy movie?,8,11,23,olmosssanchez,25 October 2020,I think the humor of this film is not for everyone; but I think this is more than a comedy. Borat makes us see the reality of things thanks to the humor that he manages. Borat's only "bad" is that at times it feels slow for the hour and a half that lasts. But I think Sacha Baron Cohen does a great job handling this mod.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206661/?ref_=tt_urv
 ROTFL,8,11,23,vidagabi-429-803187,25 October 2020,I can't even remember the last time I laughed so hard and as much as last night watching this one. SBC for the win!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205791/?ref_=tt_urv
 Maybe I don't get it,10,11,23,thethomasfamily-79545,25 October 2020,I am baffled. Is the point of this movie franchise to embarrass people? Like a less funny or clever version of "Nathan for You"? It's incredibly awkward and I found myself cringing the entire time. There is a great way to do awkward humor and this just made me feel bad for the people who were forced to interact with this incredibly annoying and ridiculous character. 2 stars because of production value,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205339/?ref_=tt_urv
 The best political comedy,7,11,23,pooyaa-02593,25 October 2020,This was a really smart movie with many real hidden camera scenes. Very political; very liberal and very true.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203820/?ref_=tt_urv
 Looks more favorably on Americans than they realise,10,11,23,the-caitlin-hill,25 October 2020,One thing I noticed about this film; was the heart. American's unwavering commitment to be polite; to mind their own; to show respect to foreigners who they have a business transaction with... We want them to say; "how dare you?" or "you can't do that!"; but they are set up to believe that the people being filmed are important to some foreign country; and they want to be respectful on camera; and make their money to get by... Even at the Republican Women's meeting; though some women were fuming; they were respectful and championed the daughter to have a voice; which was admirable; even if I disagree with their fundamental world view. This is then juxtaposed with the hate and misogyny: how abortion is wrong no matter what the circumstances; how men and women would sell off a woman or take advantage of a woman at any point; the hate for other people; other countries... but; everyone has rights; which they are disappointed in but stick by.
So; if one was to walk away from this and go; it's just an attack on Republicans or Americans et al; I would say they have missed that it's actually against hate for others and against the misogynistic treatment of women at all levels in society; and not just in America; but it's mostly fighting against men who have done the wrong thing by women and their country.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203788/?ref_=tt_urv
 The Comic We Deserve,1,11,23,Leo-G-Phillips,24 October 2020,Taking Borat to the now openly broken America 14 years later; Cohen skewers one piggish facet of American culture after another - ultimately cutting at some of Trumps top cronies. Pure genius meets comedic balls of steel.Watch.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202941/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat the Sequel,1,11,23,dromasca,24 October 2020,'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm' or for short 'Borat 2' directed by Jason Woliner is the most surprising production I've seen so far in this strange year; a proof that interesting films can appear despite or even due to the pandemic. The film is a sequel to the first 'Borat' made 14 years ago; resuming the American adventures of the pseudo-Kazakh character invented and played by Sacha Baron Cohen in the America of 2020. One of the things that happened during this time was was the series 'Who Is America' in which Cohen practiced and perfected scenarios in which the imaginary stereotypes of the characters meet real people; some stereotypically banal; others at the political or religious extremes of American society. The premises are farcical until the confrontations of characters and ideas make them seem painfully real. Satire is all the sharper as the characters Cohen / Borat encounters become more involved in their own roles; and those are the instances when comic effects are most successful and satire is devastating. However; the surprise effect is missing; not only that the formula is the same as in the original 'Borat'; but also some of the comic effects (for example using 'exotic' languages) are repeated; and in almost any category the comparison with the original is unfavorable.'Borat 2' has about ten screenwriters (including Cohen); and that feels like it; because the film looks like a succession of scenes that can be viewed as separate comic clips. The film takes the risk of upsetting just about everyone and manages to do so in full; though probably unevenly; because the political orientation of the authors is clear. Almost anyone who wants or can't avoid feeling offended will find reasons to be so in this film; but especially adepts of political correctness and those who do not believe that political; social; character satire can afford saying anything or almost anything in a movie. The novelty introduced in the pretext of the film is the character of Borat's daughter played by the Bulgarian actress Maria Bakalova. The 15-year-old girl destined to be delivered as a 'gift' for bribing politicians offers the opportunity to expand satire in the #Me Too space; but the topic gets a Borat treatment here as well. The melodramatic line of action about the relationship between father and daughter; although a bit conventional; did not hurt I believe; on the contrary; it added a necessary emotional counterpoint in the succession of comic scenes. Sacha Baron Cohen also adopts a series of disguises justified by the fact that the character Borat has an already famous physiognomy created in the original film. Both Cohen and Bakalova immerse themselves with talent and courage in environments that risk becoming hostile at any time; especially if and when they understand that they have become the subject of a filmed satirical prank. They also do not avoid confrontations with the top of American politicians; and the results on the screen are interesting; debatable; but of a comic that cannot be denied.The disguises are not perfect; I had the impression that the mascara is almost always thick; the costumes are beyond credibility; and that these imperfections are intentional; as if to give an additional but unused chance to those involved to understand the context. Jokes of all kinds and to all tastes abound; including in the use of languages. 'Kazakhstan' is filmed on location in Romania and its inhabitants speak Romanian. Borat speaks Hebrew and his daughter answers in Bulgarian. The comic effect is inevitable; amplified if you understand these languages. Being a Romanian and Hebrew speaker; I was able to enjoy a large part of the 'foreign' dialogues. But not all gags work just as well; and some of them are complete misses. The unsuspecting heroes provide moments of comedy but also of unexpected emotion (like in the synagogue scene). At its best moments; the film manages to create a aggressive and substantial comedy. At others; however; the humor is tendentious; repetitive or simply flat. Sacha Baron Cohen did not invent the 'mockumentary' but with the first 'Borat' he achieved one of his greatest successes; perhaps the greatest so far in the history of the genre. 'Borat 2' is a sequel that tries to repeat this success but is not very successful.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201469/?ref_=tt_urv
 Another Classic!,2,11,23,jayborrelli,24 October 2020,I laughed the entire time. Not sure how he gets away with these stunts especially this time but this one hits home in a huge way. He manages to poke fun at everything that is wrong with America today and it was just brilliant. Loved it; 10/10!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201247/?ref_=tt_urv
 TERRIBLE MOVIE.,10,14,31,guilhermecoelhorocha-66-787211,26 October 2020,Just bizarre.
Could be very funny but its just made of the bad parts.
The daughter is just terrible.Democrat hollywood.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207020/?ref_=tt_urv
 Awful,7,14,31,dbrown3881,24 October 2020,This movie seems so forced and it is not remotely clever or funny at all. It's too bad some people have no respect for themselves or the things they create because in my opinion he is just raping the character to make a little more money.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203251/?ref_=tt_urv
 When expectations fall flat,7,14,31,pontus-randen,24 October 2020,All of us gathered around the TV were so psyched; so thrilled. Finally another Borat. We all agreed that expecting anything like the first one was probably unwise; but we all thought we would be astonished; yet again. Maybe in another way; maybe less this time; but still...When the movie ended there was a big silence. And then some "humms". We had all tried so hard; during the movie; to laugh. We were all trying so hard now to find something fun to talk about and laugh together about. Nothing. Just "humm".Complete and utter disappointment. Nothing fun; just political and .. dumb.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200819/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious,8,7,13,gtdmac-54253,2 November 2020,Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm is easily the funniest movie of 2020 and perhaps one of the funniest of all time. A product of its' time; the film takes what are now familiar themes of Sasha Baron Cohen and incorporates them into Borat's familiar idiom. He takes you on long journey that ends in the present day with stops along the way to embarrass people left and right. He shows how strange our country has become and yet; it's a familiar kind of strange. The plot is very clever. How he pulled such an amazing series of events together is baffling. They must have had to constantly adapt to new circumstances until they got the results that made the most sense. Oh; and it's easily the funniest movie I've seen in many years. Maybe since the first Borat. I recommend it for the laughs even if you don't agree with the sentiments. It's that funny ...,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6231673/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat Subsequent Moviefilm : Sacha Baron Cohen is Back with More Outrageous Footage than Ever,10,7,13,benjaminpiche,24 October 2020,We all knew that Sacha Baron Cohen would deliver something outrageous for his theatrical return to the role of Borat... but man; I don't think anyone was prepared for that! There really is some career-ending stuff in there...Like many people; however; I am concerned about the rewatchability factor of this film (or should I say moviefilm?); which truly speaks to the time period we are in right now. Will it be as funny five; ten; twelve years from now? Probably not. At the same time; Sacha Baron Cohen is here to do some election tampering; so it doesn't really need to be a timeless comedy classic to achieve that goal.Overall; there are aspects of this movie that I really enjoyed; and others that fell kind of flat. Some jokes land; some others don't. Humour this vulgar has never been my favorite kind; but I would be lying if I said that this wasn't fun. It's an effective satire that holds a mirror at America at a time where it is most necessary.Watch this thing with an alcoholic beverage by your side; and you're going to have a great time; I guarantee it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203275/?ref_=tt_urv
 Very Niiice,7,7,13,tunesplitter,24 October 2020,Not good as the first movie; but i think thats normal. Many cringe and funny moments. i enjoyed it a lot,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203266/?ref_=tt_urv
 Pretty fun and definitely different!,1,9,18,Rageypoo,26 October 2020,So it's a bit of a culture mish-mash and that's what makes it fun. I liked most of the jokes; it started off a little slow but got better; but overall it was fun the whole way though. My initial feelings...I was glad to have seen it; and I would probably watch it again. I would not say this is a family friendly movie; I don't think a younger audience will really get a lot of the jokes; this is definitely meant for those who are part of the political environment which has been such a hot topic lately; and it does a very good job of capturing most of it. I did like the ending a lot; it has a bit of a twist I was not expecting at all which I thought was very impressive for such a film.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208612/?ref_=tt_urv
 Keep it up guys,1,9,18,nikitufkov,26 October 2020,I wish good luck to Maria and hopefully she gets involved in many other movies. We need new faces and talent especially from eastern europe; because there is not many at the moment.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208031/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not as good as the original, but still worth watching.,1,9,18,nickgray-12862,24 October 2020,The original is still one of the funniest movies of the last 15 years. This one is different; more of a movie than a documentary. Borat is; still that loveable but non pc buffoon. The story between father and daughter is cringy but also heartwarming. Maria Buklova is a defo star in the making. Good but not great like the first.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201203/?ref_=tt_urv

 Pure adulterated garbage!!!,1,15,34,jjbaker-83458,24 October 2020,Watch Sasha Baron in the Spy and you will wonder how that amazing actor produces such pure trash comedy like these movies. Sasha's Boring's comedy is not only not funny but is just pushing the media agenda on fake scandals which is already over played. Hope he makes another series like the spy before he gets hit by a bus. Not sure which I will enjoy more.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201306/?ref_=tt_urv
 R Rated Slap-stick Comedy With a Kicker,1,21,51,wmygreg,23 October 2020,The movie reminds me of a Three Stooges episode brought forward in time and with an R rated theme. The movie rambles around in an attempt to expose social and moral hypocrisy and does so in a predictable manor. It would be a total waste of time but for the crescendo of "exposing" a leading political hypocrite; Rudy Giuliani. Rudy becomes the "star" of the movie because he is the only one who doesn't understand that he is the principal "Stooge". Seeing him caught with his "hand in the cookie jar" provides the grand laugh of 2020.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198652/?ref_=tt_urv
 All the bulls**t aside,10,16,37,kurtismichaelgibbs,24 October 2020,This movie has more laugh out loud moments than 95% of all comedies in 2020.
Whether you're right wing or left wing or whatever the hell; this is just funny. No it's not the exact same as the first movie; but what were you expecting?,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200855/?ref_=tt_urv
 Skip,10,17,40,michael-561-692892,25 October 2020,Humorous that Amazon; the massive tech empire under the recent attention by AOC and 3 for monopolistic business practices; threatened to be investigated and potentially broken apart; fans the left with more glory... feeding the youth with more anti American propaganda... attacks the right; which traditionally is more capitalistic and would favor Amazon. So you have a catch 22 here... attack the dog that feeds you to ultimately be destroyed by the left who you seem to love so dearly.As far as this "film"... borat returns; this time to go full force on one particular group of people in the US. What made the first film funny was that he just went after everyone.If ratings weren't obvious enough guys... I don't know what else will cause these loons to re-align. Go woke and go broke. However; the down votes come from the kids who think it's cool still to rebel against society; wearing graphic tees; joggers and park ranger hats on Instagram. Or the others that paid 200g for degrees that ultimately mean nothing to society and expect everyone to pay for their mistakes.If I could rate this propaganda a 0 I would. And I'm not even the demographic attacked in this pathetic 1.5 hour waste of time. Not even gypsy tears can save this dump.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204364/?ref_=tt_urv
 Shock Value Emotional Abuse,8,13,29,dawnmhudspeth,24 October 2020,It's not funny or clever. A narcissistic sociopath creating shock value moments.

 You know who to vote!,1,10,21,pradhan_arjunrulez,24 October 2020,Sarcastically on point. Very well made movie during pandemic ; not as funny as borat 1 but serves its purpose with great humor.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200958/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not as strong as the first Borat, but still funny and worth watching.,10,10,21,goombapizza,24 October 2020,The gags weren't quite as outrageous as in the first film (which I consider a 10); and it was a bit slower-paced; and it felt more scripted; and once you're familiar with the Borat process it loses some of its novelty. That being said; this movie is a solid comedy with plenty of chuckles and some great laugh-out-loud moments. If nothing else; it's worth it just to watch a certain politician/lawyer be put in a very compromising situation toward the end of the movie. I recommend it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200638/?ref_=tt_urv
 Better than the 1st!,7,10,21,andielaps,24 October 2020,I didn't like the 1st Borat movie and only reason why I watch this one; is because my husband asked me to. I laughed though the whole film. My favorite personal favorites are the baby; the father and daughter dance; the bathroom scene at the convention; and the end with Rudy.Don't know why people are hating on this. Honestly I expected this movie to really suck; because I really hated the first one. However I was really surprised; I laughed throughout the movie.Watch it!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200328/?ref_=tt_urv
 Scenes filmed in empty rooms then cut in,10,14,32,DesertBeagler,24 October 2020,In the scene where the girl is dancing with her period; you can see the blood on the floor disappear then re-appear in different shots. They likely filmed this scene in an empty room then cut it in to make it look like it was in front of an audience.This is the kind of misleading garbage that SBC has devolved to.The Giuliani scene had similar tricks and ended up being a huge letdown. He WAS clearly tucking his shirt back in; after the girl tugged it out when removing his mic.I also find it annoying that all the media outlets were reporting she was referred to being 15 years old through out the interview. Not once is "15" mentioned in the scene until after the bed shot when SBC bursts in and says she's 15.Not a fan of the guy and it's obvious what he's thinking but it's hardly some massive "caught red handed" moment they hyped it up to be.All in all SBC just looks like he's doing a bad impersonation of Borat; and the whole joke of the film is supposed to be pointing out how crazy conservatives are. Which; by itself; is not funny.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202857/?ref_=tt_urv
 he's a genius,8,14,32,irafaelsanchezjr,24 October 2020,For those who got mad over the movie; then they accomplished what they where aiming for.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200900/?ref_=tt_urv
 Funny and wild, but something is still missing,9,6,11,Gordon-11,24 October 2020,It is funny and wild; but there is something missing. The first one was super funny because of the reactions of other people. This subsequent moviefilm has much less surprised or disgusted reactions. People are just so calm about what they see.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201074/?ref_=tt_urv
 Get Crazy With Borat, Again,8,6,11,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,24 October 2020,Stream to Big Screeners; we're in the middle of Halloween season; but we had to take some time to get some laughter. This week Prime Video released Borat Subsequent Moviefilm. This is the sequel to Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. Honestly; I got tricked and hassled by Trip Fontaine into watching this film. I am not a big fan of Sacha Baron Cohen; but I can suffer through it to review for our viewers. Let's see how crazy this gets.Needless to say; Borat is completely crazy and it follows that his daughter is just as insane. This film is full of satirical; political commentary and; sadly; also just the reality of parts of America. The jokes are crisp and clever. It is sad that people actually fell for this while being recorded - again. I feel like some of these bits are entirely scripted; but I know that much of it is too close to real. Sasha Baron Cohen and Maria Bakalova really do capture the political insanity that has consumed America throughout 2020. For me; some of this is just a bit too much but what is satire without great exaggeration? It's bad comedy. Here; we have comedy that ultimately works and highlights the culture in which we live. The only thing I want to highlight is thank goodness for the Jeanise Jones's of the world. She's my favorite part of this movie. I must also shoutout the idiots trying to explain to Borat what a conspiracy theory is in this movie. This scene became way too close to showing the depressing division in this current political climate we are stuck in. Honestly; we have to thank Sacha for putting idiot ideology on front street. I'm looking at you Rudy Guiliani.Long story short; I suffered through this comedy but I'll admit I did laugh some. Borat does Borat things. If you enjoyed it before; then you'll enjoy this too. There isn't a rush to watch this but any undecided voters should definitely grab a bowl of popcorn and watch this before election day.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200603/?ref_=tt_urv
 6.9 average because the penny dropped on some Americans.,8,8,16,gfficom-32291,1 November 2020,The reviews range from very high to very low producing a 6.9 average. There are enough good reviews here without the need to repeat them.I'll only add that the unexpected bonus in these reviews is that the negative American reviewers have finally realised that they are the quarry and not foreigners and Kazakhstan which some of them seemed to think after the first movie. The joke is still on them. The other thing I learned is that it is possible to laugh with a dropped jaw; but it feels a bit weird.The synagogue scene was superb. The ladies were beautiful. SBC character owed a lot to Peter Sellers at his best.The best use of this work would be for it to become compulsory viewing for education planners in the USA.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6225751/?ref_=tt_urv
 A decent follow up to a cult classic.,9,8,16,samgellard-83556,26 October 2020,It is easy to see why people are offended by films such as these; however feel that is exactly the point. The content is meant to shock; its produced in a way that makes you question whether you're a good or bad person for laughing. This is real satire. No individual in a position if power is safe from Sacha Baron Cohen; the man is a genius. Though weaker than the first film I still found myself laughing out loud at the majority of the film. Would fully recommend. Very nice!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208908/?ref_=tt_urv
 Mayhem with a heart,1,8,16,thinkingdigital,24 October 2020,I was dreading this movie as I do with all sequels to movies I like. But I had needn't have worried; BSM was a joy from start to finish. The laughter invariably came through gritted teeth; clenched fists and pure dread.There was plenty of the usual Borat gross-out stuff; coming in both physical and moral forms but what surprised was there was genuine heart of the film...Enter... Maria Bakalova. Wow. I fell in love with her character in the first five mins. Her intensity and commitment never lets up... Her performance is beyond words... hilarious; terrifying and heart-breakingly enchanting throughout.But what an all round team effort - putting this together would have been a logistical nightmare. Respect to Sacha Baron Cohen for noticing talent when he sees it and being generous enough to give over screen time to Bakalova.It's a really is a brilliant sweet movie.Enjoy.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203558/?ref_=tt_urv
 Better than the first,2,8,16,akshatmahajan,24 October 2020,Borat Subsequent Moviefilm like first part; was fairly amusing.The satirical idea for the film is simply brilliant. The character of Borat is same as first; brilliant.The movie starts slow but with time; movie becomes amazing and the ending was unexpected. It's execution was better than the first one.There are no proper words to describe Cohen. His dedication and perfection in this role is nearly unheralded in my mind.Overall; I would recommend everyone to watch and enjoy it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201865/?ref_=tt_urv
 Destined to polarize,10,8,16,lwfym,24 October 2020,It's obvious that this movie wouldn't live up to the original. There's not nearly as much public skits because of how well-known the Borat name is nowadays; and it was those skits that made the original so big in the first place. Knowing that; Cohen tries to make up for it by focusing on a few bigger scenarios involving people in power unknowingly starring in the movie.I personally had a blast watching the spectacle unfold with the Borat character along with how the story weaves in current events in hilarious ways. The movie also has a much harder political edge than the first movie; which will make it a hard sell for some. It's still more than worth the watch. Sacha Baron Cohen is still great as Borat and Maria Bakalova puts in a solid performance as well!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201360/?ref_=tt_urv
 US&A will watch this.,7,8,16,gabrielkyforslund,24 October 2020,I loved the first movie and im not gonna lie; this is as close as it gets in these modern times. Its hard to fool people like Sacha and yet he still succeeds in many hilarious ways. Borats daughter Tutar is alot of fun; I laughed way to many times and her acting is brilliant. SHE FOOLED RUDY FFS AND almost got away with it. So it became "extra" brilliant to not just laugh at Sacha; but to her aswell with hilarious punch lines and good executed comments togheter with her father.I can't help it to feel bad for all the people in this movie tho. Im not from America so I can't comment on their political status (more than I've read from the news in Sweden). But still I guess they got what they deserved. For me watching the movie from another country without any knowledge about America was a joyfull but frightening experience. Especially the scenes with Judith the jew. I heard that she passed away (may she rest in piece) and that her daughter actually sued Sacha for making the film and was demanding that they removed the scene with her from the movie. I understand that to 100% but still. Probably the most beautiful part of the movie that Judith actually accepted Borat for being a jerk; giving him a hug and saying the word "hope".I truly think this is a masterpiece in all ways. You can seperate the scenes from reality and still stay very close to the content of this film. What an absolute blast it was but I must admit; many of the scenes where very very very immature. Like the sequence at the prom/ball with all the daughter and fathers. I wish I could see the aftermath from that building but it skipped to the next part directly. It portayed America and the Donald Trump followers like complete idiots but still with balls of still managed to live among them and speak to them as they respected Borat.GREAT ACTING - VERY VERY FUNNY - SACHA EXPOSED EVIL TO THE TRUTH - MADE AMERICA LOOK STUPID AGAIN*CHENGUI Sacha; I sincerelly hope that I will meet you someday.^thank you???,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200526/?ref_=tt_urv
 A sloppy pamphlet,10,15,35,carlosrib-56808,24 October 2020,Go woke; go broke. A piece of unfunny and scatological cliches; lazy and lame political propaganda. Shame on you Amazon.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202080/?ref_=tt_urv
 BARELY FUNNY AND FULLY BIASED,10,15,35,actorryanbates,24 October 2020,Remember when Borat made fun of everyone?
There was a few laughable moments; but was not at all what I was hoping for.
Was expecting a more unbiased comedy poking at everyone.
Just another example of one sided film making; heavily disappointed.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200807/?ref_=tt_urv
 A remarkable feat,10,11,24,Drabble500,26 October 2020,Got to hand it to Sacha Baron Cohen; this is a remarkable feat. Okay; so in a few places there's some staging but a lot of it is clearly filmed straight; fooling people into revealing some jaw-dropping stances.It's cringe-making in many places at an almost unwatchable level but only because it's so funny.What makes me award this 10 stars is that it's very brave to have made this in 2020 in the run-up to the elections and in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. A number of the pranks put Sacha's life on the line.My only reservation is the moment in the synagogue but; wow; those ladies came out of it beautifully.Full marks to Maria Bakolova who plays the daughter brilliantly.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208567/?ref_=tt_urv
 So excellent casting,10,11,24,anxiousgayhorseonketamine,24 October 2020,On one level one could see and describe accurately the fact that Sacha Noam Baron Cohen born to an Israeli mother and a known supporter of Zionist beliefs; see YT videos where he addresses Jewish groups in the US; chose to make fun of a 70.2% Muslim country (see Wiki). Would we sit comfortably with say an Iraqi comedian making fun of the Shtetl or God forbid The State of IsraelThere would probably be many suits very quickly; Anti-Defamation League etc etcBut that way round he is seemingly unconcerned about his "choice"; as is almost everybody else in the West
Since we know little about this huge country ... we let it pass====OK that out of the way let us talk about Borat 2====Is it as funny as Borat 2006? NoIs is still better than most comedy outthere? Resoundingly yesHere there is more of a storyline than in 2006. You have to admire him pulling this off during Covid ... there must have been many practical impediments. The Bulgarian actress who plays his daughter is a perfect foil; in fact she is so good at what she did here that at times you pay more attention to her than to BoratSo excellent casting
As always in the Cohen's oeuvre you can watch this as a sniggering 14-year old or as an adult and yes you are allowed to switch back and forth as you watchNot much else to say really. The trailer promised more than the film delivered; so kudos and bit of a shameThe best thing that has happened in my town in 2020 is the erection for a weekend of a Golden Statue of Alan Partridge outside the main library; this is Borat 2 is the second best comedic event of the year thus far ....Thank you Mr Cohen; keep trucking' maybe some new characters .... must not flog a moribund horse ; although Borat probably would,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201697/?ref_=tt_urv
 A wa wa woo wa,8,11,24,ilouis,24 October 2020,Sacha Baron Cohen back doing what he does best!
This guy is in a league of he's own. While a lot more of this Sequel is scripted; due to Borats high profile; these scenes are more for plot development and build up to the real scenes with the aim of people exposing themselves. For me; the three standout scenes that showcase this were; the abortion clinic; the final interview; and the ball. The daughters reaction to her father offering a large sum of money in exchange for Borat's daughter was priceless; and the fact it was so genuine made it 10x funnier.
The way the film ties in with current events but is also not constantly about covid is done extremely well and creates a great story line.
In my opinion this film is just as hillairous as the original; but just at a less frequently; but is made up for with the better plot and conclusion.A special mention to the supporting actress who seems relatively unknown; but gave an exceptional performance. I definitely expect to be seeing more of her in future films. And of course Sacha the GOAT never disappoints!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201592/?ref_=tt_urv

 I loved the first one, but this was even better!,1,11,24,unison-369-306249,24 October 2020,I compare the first one to Jackass. A bunch of cringeworthy segments; but this one had a plot tied into the cringeworthy segments. Maria Bakalova has balls of steel to keep up with the master Sasha Baron Cohen. She was more than delightful and mega comedy chops. The storyline which I didn't put much thought into at first turned out to tie it all together in a great way. Worth the time and I will watch it again tomorrow.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201055/?ref_=tt_urv

 How this can be any good?,2,16,38,mmaher-88427,24 October 2020,The most disturbing movie I have ever seen; to picture women to be treated like cows in a neglected barn in some countries.
This is not discussing a case; because there is no such case even in some conservative countries towards women rights; there is no example like what the movie pictures with all of that disturbing exaggeration.
Those disturbing scenes I saw were covering comedy with sadness.
This one is sad to be even evaluated.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201564/?ref_=tt_urv

 Not so funny anymore...,10,12,27,woollyfuller,24 October 2020,Tired jokes and the shock value has waned somewhat.Basically; it's a political agenda movie. I think this is another tired excuse to play an increasingly overplayed game.Watch it if you're a die hard Borat fan; it does have a few decent laughs. The cringe factor is based more on the lecture messaging; than the gags.Cohen is a great comedy actor and I'm sure there is better to come from him soon...,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203155/?ref_=tt_urv
 I don't like,7,13,30,RussHog,23 October 2020,I am a big fan of Sacha and I think he is on the right side of history but this movie is lazy compared to the genius of the original. The jokes aren't funny. The fake interviews aren't shocking. Maybe it's just that nothing is new under the sun in the age of social media - or maybe it's just because the film is flat; lazy; and stupid. The daughter character is a disaster. The stuff dealing with the Republicans is worth watching however.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199775/?ref_=tt_urv
 The movie couldn't be done without tutara,,,10,9,19,bbarrett-282-869160,31 October 2020,Without Borat's daughter in this film I believe that it would've failed. She was fantastic and she made the movie her own! She was absolutely amazing!!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6220867/?ref_=tt_urv
 Social commentary disguised as comedy,10,9,19,danielladue,26 October 2020,The first Borat film had plenty to offer in social comedy; but most of it was for shock value; and just get people to see a cross section of Americans for who they are. None of it was meant to hurt anyone; or make any big statements; but instead to entertain.It became very obvious early on that this sequel is much more about social commentary; and the political atmosphere of the time. The year 2020 has been an absolute circus; and this film is only a reflection of what we have become. Many people have said that this version is not as funny as the original; but I would argue that is nearly impossible. The first Borat film had nothing to compare it to; and thus the shock value was higher. Now we already know what to expect with the added fact that nothing feels shocking in the year 2020. Overall; I'd say that this film is indeed not quite as funny; but it did more provide more substance (weird to say about a Borat film). Sacha Baron Cohen has even admitted that he felt in danger of his life a few times; and that is a bit different than last time around. Say whatever you want about that goofy weirdo; but he is highly intelligent; and figures out how to get people to show their true nature.Lastly; we all want to see and interpret the infamous scene with Rudy Giuliani. Unfortunately; the response from Americans has been just as divided as everything else; proving the point even further. Democrats see one thing; and the Conservatives see something else. In my opinion it was pretty bad; but not quite the pedeophile stretch it was reported as; but that's just my take. I will be honest; and tell anyone of the Trump persuasion that they probably won't enjoy this at all; but overall the film has a lot of insight to anyone who isn't emotionally tied to the current administration.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208700/?ref_=tt_urv
 Fantastic,7,9,19,nickrust-30019,26 October 2020,Sasha is a genius; so so funny!
Actress playing Borats daughter is brilliant!!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207934/?ref_=tt_urv
 This comedy movie was mostly nice.,8,9,19,ironhorse_iv,25 October 2020,Jagshemash! This mockumentary once again centers around Kazakh reporter Borat Sagdiyev; a naïve misogynistic; racist; anti-Semitic stranger to American culture (Sacha Baron Cohen). While not as controversial shocking nor funny as the original. This Amazon Studios Video on Demand sequel directed by Jason Woliner deserved a high five for having more heart than the 2006 flick. While focusing on Borat's relationship with his daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) on her arranged marriage to a top US politician can get annoying at times especially with the actress use of a heavy Bulgarian accent loud over nagging voice. I found the chemistry between them generally moving. Good acting. Both individuals do grow more likeable as the film goes on and into better people. It's so unlike the first movie where the individuals mostly stay the same. Nevertheless; I didn't like what the filmmakers did with original supporting characters like Azamat (Ken Davitian) & Luenell (Luenell Campbell). I get that the performers had pay disputes; but their characters should be written off the film a little better than what we got. Still the sequel does a good job acknowledges its predecessor's success as well as the gap between movies; by explaining in universe that the first film made Kazakhstan into a laughing stock in the national stage. Thus; the government punish Borat for over a decade until he was given another chance with this sequel. Nevertheless; the guerrilla prank style filmmaking kinda has wine down since 2006; as the character's image has become way too popular. Cohen even had to retired Borat at one time due to being unable to fool unaware real people to gain access to their genuine' s reactions toward solecism for laughs. In order to make the movie work; Sacha had to put Borat under heavy makeup and new disguises or give comedic trolling the crowd scenarios to Tutar. Because of that; there is very few scenes of Borat dress in his traditional suit and acting like himself; which is a shame. To add onto that; the people that he does interacted with; seem more in with the joke than the other movie. I'm not saying that they were paid performers; but I doubt that conspiracy theorists Jerry Holleman and Jim Russell would allow a man with a filmmaking crew to stay with them for five whole days without noticing something odd during a pandemic. Bits like them going to find Tutar at a rally seem heavily rehearsed. The same can be said with Jeanise Jones who drives her to the clinic and gives a bizarre; but inspiriting semi long speech to Borat's daughter about womanhood. It's really hard to believe that these people didn't know that it was a work. The only confirm person that I can tell that was in with the joke was Holocaust survivor Judith Dim Evans. Her story was so charming that Cohen broke character. Sadly; the film's creators still got sued for fraud when her heirs brought the lawsuit alleging that Judith did not consent to the commercial use of her likeness despite otherwise. Surprisingly unlike the first movie that result in many legal actions by participants ranging from individuals to whole cities. This one had little. Still; as of this writing; it is too early to tell. After all politicians like Rudy Giuliani might sued over allegations of impropriety. The actress did kinda led him on. Regardless the country of Kazakhstan will probably continue to hate their backwater racism portrayal in these films. Some Kazakhstanis really wanted this film to be canceled. I doubt that they would be happy with the twist ending involving the coronavirus. Still it makes me wonder what was the original climax if the pandemic never did hit during the production of this movie. I can see it being much more grandeur. COVID-19 really did good a number on the flick as the banning of large gatherings meant less events for Borat to crash into. While Cohen was indeed lucky to gain access to one of the Republicans key conferences. He didn't get the reaction that he was looking for with Donald Trump like he got with Ali G with the ice cream glove business skit. It's a shame that the scenes with Trump got cut from the final version. As for the sequence with Mike Pence. That interaction wasn't as impressed in real life. Unlike the film with the long pause; Pence just continue his speech as if they weren't any disruption. Cohen was quickly escort out of the building. Unlike the first Borat flick; in which the actor was famously arrested nearly 100 times and follow by the FBI. He felt that he risked his livable more making this movie due to the harsh political unrest that came with the pandemic. Cohen even said there were two separate occasions in which he had to wear a bulletproof vest. It's safe to say that the rightwing rally where Borat sang an offensive song was probably one of them. While that song was somewhat catchy. It was still disturbing to see some people cheer him on. It reminds me so much of the 'Peace' episode of the Da Ali G Show when Borat sang a similar tune. While I do like that Cohen mocked their echo chamber attitude toward the coronavirus outbreak for all it's worth. I just wished they didn't recycle the same types of the pranks that you can see on one of his old show. It made some of the sequences somewhat tiresome. Meanwhile others felt disconnected and uncompleted like the random barbershop gag. Regardless; the humor in this is probably better than what Cohen plan in the unauthorized sequel called 'My Brother' starring Borat's mentally-challenged brother Bilo. The cringe factor in that version would be too much to handle. Overall: Dziekuje Cohen for making the right decision. In the end; while the movie is not as good as the original. It's still worth skipping sexy time to check out. A must watch.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204603/?ref_=tt_urv
 This was a masterpiece,10,9,19,chrischavez13-987-646477,25 October 2020,I haven't laughed so hard or have been so shocked so hard in such a long time. This movie brought to light the ugliness of the rising Fascism in the US in a comedic fashion.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203907/?ref_=tt_urv
 Mirror of society,3,9,19,Babydollgirl,24 October 2020,It's brilliant. No matter how much he tries to shock and be the crazy one in the end it always shows how the "normal" citizens are often much more bizarre and surreal in their own behaviour. Maria who plays the daughter deserves an Oscar for her outstanding performance. Very proud that she's a Bulgarian. Over all I'm pleasantly surprised by the sequal because usually the 2nd never equals the first movies but this time I can whole heartily say Borat 2 is amazing and everyone needs to see it. We sure could use some more laughs in life and this movie definitely provides us with laughter but also a deeper view on how ridiculous everything is happening just in front of us.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203569/?ref_=tt_urv
 Funny at times,6,9,19,kencocker,24 October 2020,The film certainly has its moments. Obviously it's from a liberal standpoint there's no attempt made to present both viewpoints; any more than there is in a Michael Moore movie. There are certainly funny moments but it's not nearly as outrageous as the original. And there is some hearts in this movie as a relationship between the two protagonists grows. The part with Rudolph Giuliani is way overblown. The only person I saw touching knees was her touching him. He pats her lightly on the back not the rear end and to me it looked much more fatherly than lecherous. She made every attempt in removing his sound equipment and coaxing him into the bedroom to make him look foolish and it failed. He was simply tucking in his pants. Much ado about nothing his treatment of her was fatherly not lecherous. Since I already pay for Amazon Prime it was worth the price of admission I wouldn't pay to see this at a movie theater,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201593/?ref_=tt_urv
 Extremely uncomfortable in a good way,2,9,19,blakebonar,24 October 2020,This film is a massive accomplishment when trying to imagine how they possibly choreographed the interviews; meetings; film crew and timelines at the various locations using the two main actors.This movie was less impressively uncomfortable than the original film; but is nonetheless a hugely successful accomplishment in streaming together a series of events and scenes into a story arc of a father and his daughter. There is no comparison with this movie; including the original film Borat; and this film will stand the test of time in my belief.This film had a few laugh out loud moments; and even more "OH MY GOD NO PLEASE" moments. As others have said; the young actress was the star of the movie and stole every scene she was in.Sacha is an icon; and his brazen exploitation of modern media and personalities is comparable to... pretty much only himself. Recommended only if you are interested in gross-out political humor with a massive dose of liberal political incorrectness (yes that's a thing).,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200566/?ref_=tt_urv
 Have we made America Great Again?,1,15,36,hscudder,24 October 2020,This was quite brilliant. America is the laughing stock. Are we not awake yet? 4 years and we're still chanting "make America great again"? Borat showed the ugliness in power; money and politics. But we haven't gotten anywhere with human trafficking which is an issue right before our very eyes daily?!? America. Wake. Up!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200829/?ref_=tt_urv
 disapointing,10,15,36,meirellesgm,24 October 2020,The movie is very disappointing. Differently from the first one; with several jokes and making funny of all; this one has an agenda and focus on politics with mostly anti-Trump. In addition; it made me laugh just a couple of times.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200550/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not cohens best but still a good watch.,1,15,36,jamesfranklin-00615,23 October 2020,I loved Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. His newest film did not have the same feel; more staged than his previous film. The political aspect of the movie was humorous but we will have to see if it ages well over the years when everything dies down.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198197/?ref_=tt_urv

 Cringe worthy,10,19,48,cknapa,26 October 2020,Terrible movie that makes you cringe. The whole premise using his "daughter" to meet Pence is just creepy; cringy; Keeping her in a cage bit is just sleazy. Even if you hate Trump this movie sucks.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208408/?ref_=tt_urv

The only reason Cohen created this mess was Trump and elections. The film lacks everything. I also think that Cohen should finally come out of his closet. He loves men's genitals way too much.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204276/?ref_=tt_urv

 Is it nicer than Melania's cage?,8,10,22,donaldricco,24 October 2020,This rating is primarily because I LOVE how the film reveals the horrible stupidity that is behind this U.S. president; his political party; and his supporters. Of course; Texas and Oklahoma feature prominently in this! It's also because I laughed quite a bit; mostly at the above stupid people. The addition of Borat's daughter works well! The only thing I noticed; for me; is that the shock value from the first movie wasn't in this one. I guess after 4 years of 45's racist; misogynist; anti-American tweets and mumblings; I've grown accustomed to that party's lies and rhetoric. Sad.As a side note; the Rudy Giuliani piece is horribly disturbing. Again; sadly not surprising; but horribly disgusting. I hope he; and his president; end up in jail. Or in a Kazakhstan gulag for life! Or stuffed into a wooden box with Kazakh Minister of Culture and top pornstar; Johnny the Monkey! Any of the 3 would suffice...,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202894/?ref_=tt_urv

 The hysteria continues!,10,7,14,henrycoles9,30 October 2020,Sacha Baron Cohen finds an actor with a comedic genius like his and the hysterical fun is now further through the roof! However; there were more scenes in this sequel that made me question how improvised they really were and whether the real people were in on the outrageous stuff happening around them; and there appears to be much more editing of these scenes. So the first movie definitely remains on the top.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6219104/?ref_=tt_urv
 The good old satire,7,7,14,sadat_oliveira,26 October 2020,Because of the cancel culture and the need to please all audiences; nowadays there are increasingly rare satire films that test the limits of humor.

 HILARIOUS!!!,7,7,14,karenclemente-03137,26 October 2020,I LAUGHED OUT LOUD!!!! honestly I do believe it was just as equally funny as the 1st movie in fact maybe even funnier because they implemented current events and we all know this year has been hella wack with Covid and all the political bs lol so In a way it was refreshing to see it all play out in a funny way through through this movie.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206984/?ref_=tt_urv
 Very nice!,8,7,14,cardsrock,25 October 2020,Sacha Baron Cohen and the makers of this moviefilm deserve a ton of credit for actually filming most of the scenes included here. Some of them are so over the top and insane you won't believe they're real. Borat is often hilarious and had me chuckling throughout most of the film. I think the beginning is the strongest; however the ending is pretty good. The plot is better than you would expect and the movie pushes it along fairly well. This movie likely won't age as well as the first one though given how focused on current events it is.It's essentially a piece of propaganda for the upcoming election; but that doesn't mean it isn't funny.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204106/?ref_=tt_urv

 No other film can give you THAT sensation,9,7,14,alexrambe-66864,24 October 2020,Thank you Sacha you made me remember my good old days watching your show; I guess this is what nostalgia feels like. At first I was surprised that I was not liking the film at all; I asked myself; Have i changed? has he changed ? has the world changed? The ridiculous sex scenes; the obscene jokes; I began thinking that perhaps I just was not into it anymore;14 years had passed after all and in those days only my inner circle of friends managed to understand and love the film; it has always been a niche; the moment one character mentions the cellphones and how is everybody holding one was when it finally hit me how much time had really passed; 'oh yeah we really did use cellphones that much back then" maybe I had grown old and grumpy and wouldn't like this movie at all. 30 minutes in and all my doubts had been removed.
THE CRINGE
That sensation that only this man knows how to produce in all its glory; luckily for me the online format allowed me to pause the film for moments to catch my breath; laugh a little and remember the good old days when this was fresh a new; many new things have appeared and therefore Borat needed adaptation; the interviews were out of the question for the simple fact that nobody would fall for that... so what can you do if you are Sacha Baron Cohen ; when your main weapon is no longer usable? I give this rating based on the cleverness of the producers and writers to make this things work taking the circumstances into account; this film is better than the original; but it is not Fresh and fights with one hand tied to its back; in conclusion this film is not revolutionary like the first one; it is not timeless like the original; but it is true to its spirit and to the artist.
The moment to watch this movie is right now and it was made with that intention in mind. Today is a 9; 4 years from now...... probably not. But it is the best we can get.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200633/?ref_=tt_urv
 Smart, funny, filthy, and shockingly truthful.,10,7,14,gsandra-26876,24 October 2020,One of my favorite scenes was Cohen; wearing a Klan getup; running through a crowded conservative Republican event featuring VP Pence. Cohen shouts: "I'm Stephen Miller." "Let me through; I'm Stephen Miller."The setups of situations exposing misogyny and gender stereotypes were brilliant. The Guiliani segment was priceless; as was the Qanon brothers expose.Cohen did an amazing job of getting this film wrapped and ready for presentation just before the election. Hats off to production staff; makeup; set decoration; director; and actors. Loved it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200408/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat without filter (nor spoiler),10,7,14,mosquitone,23 October 2020,Usually I don't like stupid or under the belt humor... And I even avoid crude humor... but... Well it may be even offensive... but...
But even if Borat may be one of the most recent "dumb films"; it's loaded with some accurate truth; politically incorrect maybe (maybe correct too much?); and addressing issues nobody would like to talk about (or does); which describes our society today; without hiding behind a false "reality" ; including during an epidemic. Wait for the ending! It's political? Hell yes. Is it fun? Hell yes. (At least for the open minded).
You don't care about politics? Hell yes!

 Joke on republicans,7,11,25,hymvn,24 October 2020,This film (like the other one) is a satirical film on republicans people; so if you are one of them; and you have sense of humor; watch it; but if is not like that I think you will be triggered. 😊
PS: smile tomorrow could be to late.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203436/?ref_=tt_urv
 I give it 5.5 out of 10,10,5,9,davidsaid,23 October 2020,Just like the majority of all sequels this pales in comparison to the first Borat film. The first Borat was near genius and incredibly funny but even Borat points out that he is too recognisable to pull the story off one more time. Hence a lot of the so called 'real people' feel like actors or people who are just going along with the joke. Yes it certainly not the fault of Cohen that his film was so successful he can no longer get away with it; but perhaps it's a shortfall in thinking that it was worth going for a second shot. It just felt a little desperate and also rushed; too focussed on what they thought was a gigantic satirical opportunity; that being 2020; the year from hell. Yes they were right; grab the bull by the horns but the bull had already dashed unfortunately. Nice try Sascha but no gold medal; maybe a bronze if you are lucky.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199639/?ref_=tt_urv
 Subsequently high achievement for make benefit boring politically correct times,1,23,61,daveelmorto,23 October 2020,The thing to know going into this is if you are not a fan of Sascha Baron Cohen and his style of humour you should not bother watching this And I imagine that the negative reviews will be from either people who don't him and his style or from the PC police who will be upset that the politically correct agenda they want everyone to adhere to so they can feel like good people is tossed out the window tongive a few good old fashioned laughs... That out of the way...
Is this belated sequel (one that I personally never thought would get made) any good???
HELL YES!!!! It's not as candid or as raw as the original film; but with Mr Baron Cohen not being able to dupe because he is recognised by so many now this film still has the power to make you fall off your seat laughing; cringe at what is happening and be shocked (in at least two scenes all of these at once)Thank you Sascha Baron for bringing back yoir most endearing character... Special mention to the lady who plays his daughter her portrayal is brave and hilarious and ultimately is what makes the scripted story part of this movie both hilarious and heart warming... Oh and there is a brilliant twist
In my humble opinion along with The Gentlemen the best movie of 2020 so far,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198016/?ref_=tt_urv
 So Funny I Farted...,1,12,28,chris-486-260073,24 October 2020,Twice! Seriously; I was laughing so hard that I couldn't hold it in. The jokes won't land for about 43% of the United States. But for the 53% on the right; or should I say left side; this will be hilarious.If you are tempted to down vote my review at this point; then this movie definitely is not for you. I encourage everyone else to to watch. The plot is somewhat slow but the comedy more than makes up for it.I owned and watched the original many times and I will watch this again. I'm frequently on my phone or working on my computer while watching TV or movies; but my phone stayed in my pocket the entire time. I believe that is as much a testament as dumptrump and Borat fans need.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200778/?ref_=tt_urv
 Where to start!,1,18,46,NFazakas,23 October 2020,Wow! There's too much content here to properly synthesize this film; i'm flustered. It's just too damn funny. Beyond the obvious political agenda and glaringly satirical overtones; Cohen has reproduced the *perfect* comedy for all personality types...mature personality types...so long as one refuses to get caught up in the sarcastic details. Not to mention the whole idea is to comfort all those who feel "lost" in these uncertain and unfamiliar times. Borat; once again; reminds us that once we stop caring about the societies overwhelming idiosyncrasies; we can all live in social harmony. Yes; i will admit some of the themes felt...forced. Being where we are as a race; i still believe this is a very strong and relevant work of art. Absolutely hilarious. I have left spoilers out so your first viewing experience can be a...hmmm...what's the phrase....ah right....great success!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197706/?ref_=tt_urv
 Best movie of 2020,10,14,34,theodenisengard,24 October 2020,Best comedy made after Borat 1. If you don't like this movie you have no sence of humour. Great Success Sacha Baron Cohen.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200695/?ref_=tt_urv
 A disappointment,10,16,40,kinghans-53748,26 October 2020,I loved the first Borat but this was awful; a movie made to help skew and election when most people watch movies to remove themselves from everyday life and the dominant election.What a waste of 2+ hours; I would say 'that's two hours I'm never getting back' but fortunately our clocks went back so I got 1 hour back.Movie wasn't funny; SBC obviously has issues; the movie was about selling an underaged girl who is getting implants so he needs to get his head checked because that's not comedy.Just rewatch the original.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208204/?ref_=tt_urv
 Oppressive,8,15,37,chloelaineshepherd,24 October 2020,Absolutely disgusting film; so oppressive towards women. No wonder the male-female authority still exists of films like this are being made. There is no funny element about this film; and I am shocked that in 2020 films like this are still allowed to be made.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203547/?ref_=tt_urv
 If this is what gets high ratings our culture is doomed.,9,15,37,wingthwong,24 October 2020,I no longer go into watching a film with high or low expectations. I go in subjectively. SBC has never been even remotely funny. I watched the first one to see how stupid a suprising majority of U.S. citizens were in respects to the unfunny; crude,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202037/?ref_=tt_urv
 A Perfect Sequel,8,8,17,HabibieHakim123,28 October 2020,"Finally a good sequel; i think this is a better then the first one; it's more interesting; more funny; and of course more shocking; this sequel proof Sacha Baron Cohen acting skill after 14 years not to be Borat character and his acting is still awesome; not less but better; i highly recommend; but make sure watch the first one first",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6212609/?ref_=tt_urv
 Pure Brilliance,1,8,17,notwithoutannette,25 October 2020,Finally someone has the guts to show how sad this country has become and make us laugh while doing it. Not an easy thing to do.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204173/?ref_=tt_urv
 Great success,10,8,17,TheCorniestLemur,25 October 2020,This was far better than I expected it to be. I had fears that this would be too self-referential; too unnecessary; too much like the first film...the list goes on. But somehow; after the character becoming an icon of the 2000's; and virtually everyone knowing who Borat is; the one and only Sacha Baron Cohen somehow managed to make another feature length display of idiots being duped.And that might be the most impressive thing about it. If you're worried this won't be as wacky or as revealing of American culture as the first Borat; worry not. And yet again; somehow...not a single time does Sacha break character. Somehow. And he's just as entertaining to watch as he was the first time around.And yet again; the only major characters who know exactly what they're in are just Borat and Tutar; who is an AMAZING addition. They play off each other really well; she's never annoying; and Maria Bakalova can easily hold her own in terms of craziness and complete lack of social awkwardness; even against Sacha. And I really wasn't expecting to care much about her and Borat's relationship; but they even managed to pull that off too.Admittedly; this doesn't have quite the same timelessness of the original film; nor is it as shocking; by its very nature; but it was certainly very welcome in the present; even if it might not be in the future.Oh; and who exactly is filming Borat this time?,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204031/?ref_=tt_urv
 An Absolute Pearler,10,8,17,The-Sarkologist,25 October 2020,You really have to wonder how this film came together; especially with some of the scenes at the end. Mind you; I guess they really did roll with the times quite well; because I suspect that as things changed dramatically around March 2020 they had to completely rework the script at the last minute; but then again CoVid really did take the world by surprised (not that we didn't see anything like this coming; it is just that we basically live in our own little bubbles; and don't expect things that happen on the other side of the world to really affect us all that much).Look; I've never been a particularly big fan of Cohen; and I wasn't a particularly big fan of his first film; but a part of me wanted to see this film; even if it was because I was captivated by the trailer. It turned out to actually be pretty good; and surprisingly I found myself bursting out in laughter numerous times during the film. However; the thing that I thought was great was how the film simply seemed to roll with the times; especially since halfway through we have Borat wandering around the empty streets wandering where everybody has gone (and ends up shacking up with some conservatives for five days).Actually; that scene was pretty cool; because while on one hand there is the suggestion that he was mocking their beliefs; he was also demonstrating to us that they are actually nice guys. The fact that they let this guy stay with them for five days; and didn't get upset despite some of the really weird things that he was doing; and even went as far as to point out that his book was wrong; really does go to show that these people aren't actually the monsters that some people make them out to be.Mind you; the end scene is an absolute classic; and as Cohen indicates; we really should make up our mind as to what was really going on. It was quite funny though that the person that the joke was a target of thought that he had out played Cohen; without actually realising what was actually going on. Of course; once the film was released you can imagine that this person has immediately gone into damage control.I guess one of the problems with a film like this is that you aren't going to get the real reactions that you would if it wasn't being recorded; though I understand that Cohen does get into these things by pretending to be somebody completely different. However; the rather deadpan faces that you get with some of the scenes; such as in the family planning clinic and in the hardware store; as well as in the store with the fax machine; does suggest that while it was odd; it was not something that was really going to raise concerns (which no doubt would have had a completely different result if; say; they were using hidden cameras in the clinic).I tell you what though; Maria Bakalova was absolutely outstanding in this film; and she just falls into the role so well. The other thing is the way that they use language - like; I have no idea what they are speaking; and it certainly sounds as if they are communicating with each other; despite the fact that Bakalova is speaking Bulgarian; and Cohen is speaking Hebrew Gibberish (I'm not even sure if that is actually a language). Yet; they do it so well; and it comes across so authentic; despite the fact that it is all a put on.Yeah; this is actually a pretty cool film; and I must say that I really did enjoy it; even though it does make you feel uncomfortable in parts. Personally; I wouldn't necessarily call it eye opening; and I doubt that it is going to change the election all that much; but it was still a pretty good watch. Oh; and I did quite like the bit at the beginning where he actually played up the fact that he can't really walk around dressed as Borat anymore.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203809/?ref_=tt_urv
 A great follow-up piece,10,8,17,joeyfrats,24 October 2020,Though; not nearly as funny as the first film ; and several "gasp worthy" scenes short as the previous; this was a great way to appease the Borat in us all. Yeah; the political rhetoric is obviously Anti-Trump; but hey; it's 2020 and everyone is pissed off at something. I found a few moments that sparked a laugh; and generally entertaining throughout. But what can Cohen do? Kids; senior citizens and everyone between know of Borat. It's not like he can hide anywhere! The costumes were a great addition!
Super curious how many Civil suits the production company and Cohen get hit with... but I'd watch this again!! Give it a whirl!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200501/?ref_=tt_urv
 Propaganda,10,9,20,hampusrosenberg,4 November 2020,This movie is filled with propagranda and it's not funny in the slightest.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6236156/?ref_=tt_urv
 Spot on!,8,9,20,sadaywow,25 October 2020,There is a reason certain people are angered by this film. It shows the stuff they are willing to put up with. Funny and truthful!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205139/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat is back and he has a daughter and they are hilarious,10,9,20,mewener,25 October 2020,Tackles all social issues going on in this world with great humour;sometimes uncomfortable but that is what Mr.Cohen does best.Timing of this movie is perfect and a great time for bringing Borat back and laugh at the sad state of affairs that we are in.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205120/?ref_=tt_urv
 Should have hit before early voting,10,9,20,ryanshoe-68810,24 October 2020,Had to make an account on here just for this movie. It was hilarious in its typical fashion and anyone saying it was all staged hasn't done their research. He truly did impede on the February Michael Pence CPAC. The scenes with Rudy were legit; amongst some others yet to be told. I'm rating a 10 just in hopes of countering butthurt Trump fans that are rating it poorly.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201126/?ref_=tt_urv
 Yea, I kept thinking what would so and such think about that?,10,9,20,forgrlove-92-963793,24 October 2020,I guess we know what Sasha Baron Cohen has been doing while in quarantine!!
I think I'll just make a possibly large budget; multi national film at the drop of a hat. Now that is power my friend!
Very current! Much better than the previous ones.
I could see a lot of growth and I think more of Sasha Baron Cohen; the man and artist; in this movie.
It dealt with so many different current issues and beliefs and was not really political because he poked fun at and exposed all sides.
Mostly he exposed the inappropriateness of us not getting along with one another in the USA.
I think I have described my take on the movie without giving away any specifics.
It is silly; so know that up front.
If you feel offended; wait 2 minutes and you will be laughing as he lands on another subject.
His sidekick in the movie was a great find! Casting miracle! Lucky!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201067/?ref_=tt_urv
 If Borat were a movie,1,9,20,blazesuncaster,24 October 2020,The first Borat movie was basically a documentary of him just going around town saying racist and sexist things. but in this new movie; it is basically more of a movie than a documentary. It centers around Borat trying to get his daughter pretty to be able to marry someone. and that's basically the whole story. the reason I think this is a movie more than a documentary is because it focuses around Love and family; and how Borat finds true love for his daughter rather than needing to. there were a few funny things from this movie but there's no way that it could be funnier than the first one. If it were; there would actually be execution's towards them. the first film was way more racist and sexist. while this movie focused on being pretty much just sexist material because race is a harder thing nowadays. I thought it was entertaining Irina Nowak really shined and basically took the mantel for being the female version of Borat. Funny; racist; sexist. you know... all that good stuff. its definitely a good movie with some good jokes in it so if you like the first one; you should at least check this one out.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200761/?ref_=tt_urv
 Glad He is Back,1,9,20,marktwaterhouse-304-327812,24 October 2020,Not as funny as the original but this film has less skits and more story; probably because Borat is too recognizable. It's more like 7/10 but gave it a 10 to balance out the Republican snowflakes.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200567/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat is back!,2,9,20,lululombard,24 October 2020,Sums up the whole story as republicans vs science; if you didn't like this movie then you're probably one of the guys that attended the rally,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200351/?ref_=tt_urv

 Who built the cages Borat?,10,17,44,vodkkaa,28 October 2020,The movie is too childish; but very offensive. I made it to 18 minutes. The scene at this point was too much for me.That would be fine if the movie was funny like the first Borat movie; but this one is just awfull and not funny at all.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6212366/?ref_=tt_urv

 Giuliani humiliated. The rest: oh dear.,10,14,35,bazzer-57663,23 October 2020,The five minutes of humiliating Crazy Rudy was great (which is why I'm giving this great gobbling turkey as many as two stars) but I'm actually angry about the other hour-and-a-half when I could've been doing something worthwhile. Like sleeping. If you haven't seen it yet the Giuliani snippet is very near the end. You don't need the rest of it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200112/?ref_=tt_urv

 Amazing,10,11,26,lukemcghee,24 October 2020,Just as good as the first one. And it was refreshing comedy; and a good take on the current social climate,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202539/?ref_=tt_urv
 Sacha Baron Cohen is phenomenal,10,11,26,dr_faristuta,24 October 2020,Sacha Cohen is a true gem and this film proves it. To film this (secretly) during a pandemic was a superb achievement and risky. Borat unmasks some of the illnesses of society with his wit and solid preparation. This film is incredibly vulgar; inappropriate; politically incorrect; offensive and hilarious and so much needed during times like these.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200896/?ref_=tt_urv

 Borat Subsequent Moviefilm Review,8,6,12,theredsky,26 October 2020,A great sequel to an already excellent movie. Borat 2 is a great follow up to one of my favorite comedies of all time. Obviously; Sachs Baron Cohen is hilarious as Borat but I was surprised at how great of a job newcomer Maria Bakalova did as Borat's daughter. She is essentially the heart and soul of the film and did an excellent job playing off of Borat. The film's writing is once again excellent at showing off Cohen's comedic talents and showing the state of the United States in 2020. The film's story is excellent and I was incredibly impressed at how they incorporated the Covid-19 pandemic into the film. Quarantine started during the making of this film and they quickly rewrote the script and incredibly and expertly wove the pandemic into the story. It was seamless and felt like something they had planned from day 1. Something great that Borat 2 does is show the current state of the United States. They are a lot of jabs at the Trump administration which could/will turn some people off from the film but it's hilarious and thought provoking none the less. There is a moment towards the end of the film with a certain politician that's horrible. Not that the film is horrible but what he does is horrible. Since this is a sequel to Borat; it has to be funny and it was definitely funny. I found myself laughing at a lot of moments in the film although I prefer the first film's jokes over this one. I really didn't have a lot of issues other than the occasional slow bit here and there. Go check this out when you can but if you consider yourself right leaning; you might not get as much enjoyment out of it as others would.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6209183/?ref_=tt_urv
 "What is more dangerous? This virus or the democrat?" - Borat,9,6,12,repojack,26 October 2020,I'm generally not a comedy guy. I did see the first Borat and found it to be a hodge-podge of prank sketches with some very funny gags.Sacha Baron Cohan's follow-up improves over the original with a more story-based approach that still upends the '-isms" in America (racism; sexism; etc.) in the midst of a freaking pandemic. It couldn't be more well-timed in this brutal election season.The standout is Borat's 15 year old daughter played by Maria Bakalova (she's actually 24) who steals the show with her cluelessness and likeability.How well you enjoy this movie will depend on your own level of political ideology and tolerance to very crude and crass behavior. Personally; I found it hilarious. But it is definitely not for everybody.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207535/?ref_=tt_urv
 Maria Bakalova makes the movie.,8,6,12,robstephenson-68107,25 October 2020,Sacha Baron Cohen is a brilliant comedien- the problem he has found after the first Borat and Bruno was his fame made it more difficult for him to prank people- which is itself satirized in the movie.Borat remains a clever creation; but for me the best and most cringe inducing scenes featured Maria Bakalova- a natural comic actress who excels in some genuinely shocking scenes (Rudi Guliani in a bedroom.....). I suspect this film will be remembered as her debut in future years. Good to see Borat back; but a star is truly born as well- I suspect she will become a big star after this.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203713/?ref_=tt_urv
 Some funny gags but overall rather lame and witless and insulting to Kazakhstan,4,6,12,calorne,24 October 2020,I'm from the U.K. I'd like to see a film-maker from Kazakhstan lampooning us. They would do it very well and with more wit. But evidently they have too much class.There were some funny moments in this film; but it was mostly lame and boringly lewd at times.It also copied Sarah Cooper (who is infinitely more entertaining) with the Usual Suspects bit.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203620/?ref_=tt_urv
 Pretty good - America got fooled again.,1,6,12,lnyron,24 October 2020,It's too bad that he's more relevant than ever. That said; I dont think QAnon or the Obamagate people's mind's will be changed; but hopefully it helped show some people how ridiculous our action's look online.I thought it was pretty good; for just being an updated version (with a female lead!) of the first movie. It's funny how quickly people forget embarassment and let their guard's down and get fooled again.Objectively (IMO) not as good as We Are America but better than Borat 1; though I don't see why it would be as successful; the shock and awe is gone. We all feel how we feel about Trump and I don't think this movie is going to motivate anyone on the other side of it's Aisle.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203574/?ref_=tt_urv
 How did they do it,7,6,12,teearetwo,24 October 2020,Most sequels are boring re-hashes of their original and better works Borat 2 is as good as the original and builds on the themes of stupidity that The first film delved into. Well done SBC,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203360/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat is back,1,6,12,zarkomarinic,24 October 2020,Borat is back; but the first movie was better and more hilarious,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202980/?ref_=tt_urv
 Almost as good as the original,1,6,12,briancham1994,24 October 2020,Borat is back; and his second film does as much as can be done with the character in 2020. He is accompanied by his daughter Tutar who does a fine job of adding to the wacky comedy. The first half is still as great as the original but it declines as it's clear that their plans have fallen through and they have to desperately improvise. It is also let down by being too scripted. Overall; a fine achievement that adds a lot to the original film but does not reach its heights in the end.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202886/?ref_=tt_urv
 woke Borat,1,6,12,sadikurrahman1985,23 October 2020,I'll be quite honest although there was quite funny scenes but with borat there was to little what you see in trailer some of it you wouldn't see like borat movie daughter went up to the roof of the car and the police talked to borat that never happened in the actual movie so that was disappointing when they say borat is number 4 and tutar is number 3 is so stupid like she wasn't all that funny it felt like a tutar movie then a borat movie it shows trump right hand man almost having sex with her and she was 15 years old so there is some exposure when it comes to politics we saw more Tutar then borat it felt like kinda staged and at the end Tutar wearing a borat suit and having a boy's haircut felt like she was immating being a man truly a feminist lesbian borat film and why kill of asamat batatov and it was kinda offensive to coronavirus victims saying borat caused the virus so obviously this film was shot before coronavirus and when coronavirus started it shows more of her then borat quite a disappointment I understand rules have changed but you still could of made it into a better film it kinder changed borat personality now he allows women equality it felt like a woke film to me but there was funny scenes and they had 12 more mins then the original and still showed less of borat it's not a bad film but not great either,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198891/?ref_=tt_urv
 I loved the first one but this one not so much,1,17,45,vm29982,26 October 2020,I fell on the floor laughing in the first Borat film where Borat and Azamat are naked in the elevator. The whole thing was funny. This time not so much. The dialogue between Borat and his daughter was so frustrating. Him speaking in Hebrew and her answering in Bulgarian for minutes at a time. Getting a fax machine employee to send stupid messages where the guy is clearly smirking at this was just not funny. The Trump hate was clearly in line with the host of late night talk shows and very mundane and repetitive. We get it the media hates him and would rather have you vote for anyone else. Cohen's strength is his subtlety and mastery of language; the ability to twist words. He did not have an opportunity here due to his recognizable face in any outfit. The result is gibberish conversation in two different languages that has no meaning.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208550/?ref_=tt_urv
 Cohen doing a Borat impression.,10,4,7,richardbates7,25 October 2020,I'm a massive fan of the original and this film too deserves a watch; however it loses its edge and appeal as everyone knows who he is and it's the stupidity of the public that makes the film work .. Cohen appears to be doing an impression of Borat; the voice is even different,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204979/?ref_=tt_urv
 Forced comedy,10,16,42,dogonlion,28 October 2020,People think this guy is a genius? Showing a man's behind; strap on penises etc. is not comedy. That's stuff that 10 year olds laugh about. What's next? Fart jokes? Even the poster photo looks like trying too hard to make people who want to laugh laugh.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6212929/?ref_=tt_urv

 Trash,9,20,55,john_brees_uk,26 October 2020,I was a huge fan of the first one. This one misses the mark. It's crude; goes too much for shock. It wasn't funny I actually was bored in it.

 Worst movie ever!,10,15,39,johnnbradshaw,24 October 2020,Worst movie ever; right next to "It's Pat". Epic fail on trying to gaslight negative situations on the republican party right before the election. A poor example of what the left thinks humor is.....we've seen so much better from Cohen....we need more humor; and less garbage politicking...shameful,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202537/?ref_=tt_urv

 The thesis of both Borat movies is that Americans are generally willing to put up with far too much to avoid rocking the boat, and that this is dangerous.,1,7,15,cdb8866,30 October 2020,The thesis of both Borat movies is that Americans are generally willing to put up with far too much to avoid rocking the boat; and that this is dangerous.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6217966/?ref_=tt_urv

 Return to form for Cohen after 20 years - a feel-good film for feel-bad times,1,7,15,gelf-46258,24 October 2020,I have been a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen since his original Ali G Show on Channel 4 in the UK (not listed on his Filmography; but found when searching for "da Ali G show" - the UK and the two US seasons mentioned as a single series). That single set of six episodes was brilliant.However; continuations of the themes from this "one trick" show proved increasingly cringe-worthy. This includes the two-season U.S. version of the Ali G show/ various "made for video" films such as Ali G in the USAiii; as well as films like Borat and Brüno (all based on characters from the Ali G Show).Meanwhile Cohen's other roles in Hugo and Sweeney Todd did not convince. When stepping out of the role of luring people into a trap in order to open up about their actual thoughts "The Dictator" was enjoyable; yet forgettable.So; two decades after I saw truly inspiring Cohen "content"; the Mrs. and I sat down; having watched two fairly terrible TV-show episodes (unrelated). And I apologized to the Mrs. in advance: "This is also going to be terrible; sorry; it's either this or an old Blu-Ray."We had a memorable evening. As if we saw a great film (The wizard of Oz; Gone With the Wind; Casablanca; Star Wars; E.T.; Back to the Future) for the first time.And no; we're not going to have a Citizen Kane-like 80-year discussion about this film. At best it will have "fair use" segments of it shown in historical context; mostly on whatever the term "WOKE" will turn out to mean historically for our time period. Heck; in a year or two; I may only give this six or seven out of ten stars.But I'll forever remember the evening when I saw this. When this was the best thing to come out in 2020. It made us feel better. Happy even.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203499/?ref_=tt_urv
 Love Borat-1, Borat-2 is just sad,1,19,52,apitchko-03266,26 October 2020,Just a political; election year; rushed; poor movie. Sasha is such a smart guy; who made some awesome movies but this one is by far the worst. It's just anti Republican smear movie; it got no other punch lines. with all political stuff this year; this movie just piles on more on top. If you are die hard democrat you will love the movie; if you non political or republican then this movie is just sad. Sasha can do much better then this.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208813/?ref_=tt_urv
 The ultimate rubbish,8,14,36,phxmike,26 October 2020,This is a huge disappoinment. The first part was funny and fresh; while this is just disgusting. Turned it off after 33 minutes. Also the film is so dark you can't see much most of the time. This sequel is a disgrace! Do not waste your time on it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208035/?ref_=tt_urv
 Trash,3,22,62,dahack-76741,27 October 2020,Not funny and fake. This isn't a comedy; it's a juvenile political attack job; and I'm not even American.

 You've got to be kidding me.,10,13,33,widderic,3 November 2020,Barely anything form the original Borat film was showcased here.

 Very disappointing film,10,12,30,andrew_enders,30 October 2020,I was expecting some good laughs from this film. All I get is a film that feels very staged for the most part.

 For an acquired taste,1,8,18,Floated2,29 October 2020,This sequel of the 2006 released film Borat may be seen as last tame hit is in many ways different than the original. This time around; Borat is accompanied by his 15 year old daughter. And she may have been the highlight as she steals her scenes; this is due to her cluelessness and likability.The reason as to why many people don't consider this film as good as the original is because the character of Borat; we have already seen. It is not fresh and new anymore and the shock value jokes aren't as great. Yet the daughter is a new character and many seem to be giving high praise for her. Including Sacha Baron Cohen who believes she deserves an Oscar nomination.Enjoyed this sequel but just as the original; it is for an acquired taste. Perhaps not as "laugh out loud" funny as the original but this is still really good and has a lot of heart; emotional input and entertaining moments. Perhaps a third film of the franchise will happen years in the future. We can only wait.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6215844/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not looking forward to the next film,10,8,18,rbcohen-75055,26 October 2020,Very funny and outrageous until it stopped being funny. Turned out to be another opinion of a far left Hollywood celebrity.

 Perfect Secuel,4,8,18,elmoreno-52939,24 October 2020,After 14 years we received an irreverent sequel at the height of the first. It is true that it does not surpass the original but the songs it deals with and the way it does it will always have the stamp of Cohen as borat and that is more than enough to be happy with this new installment.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203193/?ref_=tt_urv
 Wow.,7,8,18,petyusha,24 October 2020,Just wow. Incredible; this was a mirror shown to the American society. What in the world happened to the USA?,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203054/?ref_=tt_urv
 This is just TRASH!,1,11,27,maximgutman-424-133386,4 November 2020,I am mostly sorry I spent my time watching this.
The first Borat film was a satire and had funny moments but this one is just cheap radical propaganda.
It is clear that in every society one can find problematic groups or individuals.
Sacha Baron Cohen decided to be the poster boy of the Democratic Party by feeding the viewers conspiracy lies about the Republicans.
In one word - PRIMITIVE!
And actually really not funny.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6235359/?ref_=tt_urv

 Excellent,7,9,21,adamlennard,24 October 2020,I loved the first one and this doesn't disappoint. I'm very much right wing so I don't get the republicans getting upset learn to laugh at yourself. If you're easily offended and have no sense of humour no you won't like it. If you're blessed with a sense of humour; can laugh at yourself you will love it. Baron Cohen deserves credit for how brave he is he genuinely puts his life on the line. Plus his on screen daughter is a delight.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203181/?ref_=tt_urv
 Just Not That Entertaining,4,10,24,mackenzie-miles,23 October 2020,I was expecting more given the hype. It was basically a 90 minute slow build up to a pretty anti-climactic scene with Rudy Giuliani.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200254/?ref_=tt_urv
 Edited for Alternative Republicans,4,26,77,kelii3,23 October 2020,And that was disappointing because to be fair prior to an election parts were removed so it would not be banned by 'you know who'.

 Pretty lame,4,18,50,kurt-mccarrell,29 October 2020,Trust me when I say that I've watched *many* movies this year; given the current situation; and this I regret every minute of watching this movie. I think I've gotten more laughs from a nature documentary. This is movie is pretty mind-numbing and boring.Go watch a recent Adam Sandler movie if you want more laughs; and don't bother with this steaming pile of garbage.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6215040/?ref_=tt_urv
 Funny if have the IQ of a rock,1,18,50,wjalbrecht-12885,26 October 2020,I loved Ali G; Borat; even The Dictator. But this is hot garbage. Cohen is just pandering to the lowest common denominator for cheap laughs; and regularly misses the mark. Deceptive editing; actors playing the supposed "real people;" and parroting of the same played out political tropes we're all beyond sick of.Do yourself a favor and just watch the trailer - all the funny moments are in it anyway. Then flip on the original; it's superior in every metric.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6209025/?ref_=tt_urv
 Genuinely funny but less timeless than the 1st one,3,5,10,paris_p,31 October 2020,Borat is hilarious and a treat to watch... Again! BUT this was much less of a social satire than the first one and it was too literal politically. Many scenes; such as the father-daughter ball; even though hilarious; make you think they were put in there just to have the good old Borat doing his thing. And they make you wonder: Are they really integral to the story? (Not really). What are they trying to say? (Unclear). To whole satire of the civilized western society trying to educate Borat in the first film; was much more effective and spot-on.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6221146/?ref_=tt_urv

 Funny but formulaic,7,5,10,LovingGoodShows,25 October 2020,I was expecting more this time around. However; the movie disappointed me; as it was very similar to previous movies; relying on shocking and misleading 'participants' for comedy; with a weak plot holding it together.On the positive side; while continuing to expose prejudices; he also showed the warm side of Americans such as older Jewish women and right wing men.The famous Giuliani scene was not as damning as expected. While he was lecherous; he was mostly charming and supportive.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205211/?ref_=tt_urv
 Genius,6,5,10,cmansell-29976,24 October 2020,Sacha is back as Borat; and by gods is it a cringeworthy cocktail of hilarity. There's lots of folk that won't like this and simply dismiss it as crass and dumb; and on the surface you could be forgiven for thinking so; but it is anything but. Sacha is his usual amazing self; always staying in character through situations that would quite frankly have me pissing my pants laughing. The real treat here is his daughter. I've never seen Maria Bakalova before; but she more than holds her own on the screen and even outshines in a lot of scenes. Equally as fearless and fun as Sacha and a great sport for putting herself in a potentially bad situation with a prominent American figure. Trump supporters will no doubt cry fake and throw stones; but without verging into spoiler territory I'd say it was pretty obvious what happened and I'll say no more; other than I doubt Sacha would compromise his artistic integrity by lying. It was clear to me his only concern was cutting it short to keep his co star safe and unharmed. Good man!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203394/?ref_=tt_urv
 Disgusting trash (no matter the politics),3,65,223,persian-belle,23 October 2020,I'm not concerned about his political message.I simply found it to be disrespectful to women and disgusting.This time he took it too far; and that's saying a lot.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197694/?ref_=tt_urv
 Such a boring movie,2,10,25,kuteguy,23 October 2020,When I watch comedies then I like to watch them to be light hearted and hopefully somewhat intelligent. This movie is a 90 minute political propaganda movie with absolutely no laughs.Even the Giuliani 'hands down the pants moment' is sooo staged! His face is covered in parts. The actress basically untucks his shirt and Giuliani; a 76 yr old fat man; goes to tuck them back in - and the movie just got their perfect fake news moment to promoted themselves. Probably the only reason people actually go to watch the movie.The whole premise is silly - that Kazakhstan govt released the Wuhan virus because they were angry at the world for laughing at them.And I used to think Cohen was an intelligent man; but looks like he has lost that magic and hence why this movies is hoping to cash in on some Trump/Republican bashing. Shame Cohen can't have success just on his own but has to lean in on Trump/Republican and election time to try and profit.Total bore of a movie. and if you have 90 minutes of time to waste then go ahead and watch grass grow; it will be better than watching this movie.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200109/?ref_=tt_urv
 A movie made to push politics and voting,3,19,55,shawntae-21856,26 October 2020,In the current state of America; tensions are already high. Borat is here to fuel the fire against the republicans - if you're looking for a movie that's 90 minutes of "LoOk At HoW sTuPiD tRuMp SuPpOrTeRs Are!" then this is the title for you.It's a complete disappointment. And as others have mentioned; it's been rushed to come out before the election and that's very obvious. The production quality is low; the story is basic and almost non-existant; the characters lack depth. There's about 5 funny scenes in the entire thing. Not at all worth anybody's time.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6209211/?ref_=tt_urv
 Fine like the original.,1,6,13,ty-jensen,29 October 2020,I wasn't excited for Borat 2 because I didn't love the original which I seen back in 2007 so I was 18. Both films are fine; I don't know which is better.The humor is inconsistent; it works sometimes. Yes; I laughed out loud a few times like the Trump stuff. Borat is really edgy like the original in fact the period scene disgusted me. There are some forced jokes like Borat running around half naked and the plot was forced.If you loved Borat; you probably seen this already. If you hated Borat; you may hate this even more. If you didn't mind Borat like myself; it's worth seeing once.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6214965/?ref_=tt_urv
 Definitely better than the 1st one,3,6,13,flouraham,28 October 2020,I don't understand why poeple say it's not as good as the 1st movie; i watched the 2 today and they're both funny and it's pretty much the same style that i'd never guess it's 14 years between the 2 movies already; this movie is truly much better in the technical aspect and it has more funny moments too at least for me; the actress who played the daughter did an amazing job and i liked her character development; so she added a lot to the concept of Borat.
I really enjoyed this movie a lot and i hope poeple will stop comparing the 2 because it felt more like a continuity.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213262/?ref_=tt_urv

 Don't believe the fake reviews. This film is disappointing.,10,13,35,plangdon-48221,23 October 2020,Oh dear. I do wish film studios would stop funding fake reviews.This film is such a let down. I think I laughed once and it wasn't at the humiliation of a lovely old Jewish lady or the vulgar menstrual blood dance.The first Borat and Bruno were hilarious but this one? Nah.

 Very disappointing compared to the first,7,7,16,ourthunder,24 October 2020,While the first movie flowed; this felt forced and quite try hard throughout. Most "victims" seemed aware early and everything after that just broke any sort of illusion knowing that footage was needed. It's a shame as the first was a genuinely good watch; and I was thoroughly looking forward to this; but almost nothing worked here.
Maybe worth a watch for the most die hard of SBC fans; but I wouldn't spend money on a movie ticket; wait until it's streamable or on TV,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202739/?ref_=tt_urv
 Perfect Movie for these Times!,1,7,16,clintcarter-28550,24 October 2020,I watched the this skeptical that I was going to see a lot of recycled gags and that it would come across as a desperate attempt to revive a character that should be left in the past.

 Unexpectedly great,6,7,16,louiek-77581,23 October 2020,I consider Borat Cultural learnings etc. to be one of the best comedies ever made; so although I was excited for this; I was hesitant because I didn't except it could match up to the original. I was wrong. This is some of Sacha's best work; and the climax of the movie (no spoilers) is absolutely jaw dropping.I give it an 8-9 only because it didn't have as much of the narrative + real world blending; a lot more of it was scripted than the original. That isn't to say that this makes it boring; just that obviously Sacha is at his best during real world scenes. I must also acknowledge that many people have reviewed this quite low most likely because of political leanings; but even I; who consider myself more right leaning found this to be a completely transparent and truthful look at the sad state of America.Everyone has prime so I see no reason anyone shouldn't watch this.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200114/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not a home run,1,3,5,eatpajdittsvin-520-811150,25 October 2020,Unlike the first Borat movie (and his appearance in Ali G before that) this Borat movie rarely manages to drive big points home. If I had to guess; it's partly because of the (ironically probably more thought through) script making it seem less genuine; relying too much on pure shock (ala Bruno); or simply being victim of measuring up to the past success of Borat.I think Sacha Baron Cohen's recent Who Is America is honestly a much better watch if you're interested in contemporary American politics and society. Borat: Subsquent Moviefilm simply doesn't manage to show us much that's worth remembering a week; a month; or a year from now (despite being linked to the election). I had a good time watching it with the family though and had more than a few laughs; so I will rate it mid way as such.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206304/?ref_=tt_urv
 A Good Outrageous Sequel,1,3,5,alindsay-al,25 October 2020,So last month a trailer came out of nowhere for Borat 2 and would be released on Amazon Prime and for fans of the first film that came out 14 years ago this was something to look forward to and now it is here with us and I have just watched it and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Borat return to The United States to gain favour with Donald Trump for his home country of Kazakhstan.Main Character
In my opinion Sacha Baron Cohen's iconic role is that of Borat so seeing him return to the role all these years later is fantastic; he still has it and even after all these years he still is as outrageous as he was back then. It is nice to see that he can give a strong dramatic performance in Trial Of The Chicago 7 and then not long after switch it up and play this really funny off the wall character. Some of the things that come out of his mouth in this film are crazy and will make you laugh.Supporting Characters
Maria Bakalova is a new actress to me and she plays Borat's daughter in this film and she really shines here; she even manages to go punch for punch with Cohen in terms of outrageousness and craziness. This is an actress that will probably get more work after this and it will be great to see just where her acting career goes from here. Now this film is unique as pretty much everybody else are real people that weren't exactly sure they were in a movie and it mostly works as the reactions are genuine and it is funny throughout.Story
The story isn't the most important part of a film like this but I have to talk about it. There is actually more depth to this plot; the relationship between Borat and his daughter is quite sweet and is well done and just the stuff to do with politics is crazy and highly entertaining. But there were some elements of the plot that didn't work for me; there are just some unnecessary parts of the film that are there just to set up a specific joke which didn't work for me. Also there is a twist at the end of the film and even for a film as controversial as this one I am not sure now was an appropriate time for it and it felt a bit tasteless.Script
Now let's face it a film like this the most important thing is whether it is funny and the answer is yes it is funny; but not really funny. There are some really funny bits here; some of the things that are said are just really funny and really fit the tone of this film. Also the little bit of heart added here is nice to see. But there are some jokes that do fall flat; it is mostly the ones involving the less mad storylines; and when the other person to Borat doesn't really play along.Style
This film will go down as one of the mad styles ever; so basically Sasha Baron Cohen went around as Borat without people knowing they were being filmed. Obviously the now well known scenes with the politicians have been controversial but really feel unique and show the awfulness of politics; also this film does a great job of just insulting everybody. Though more then the first film; it feels like this is a really strong 1 hour special that had to force an extra 30 mins in order to qualify as a film which makes some parts of the film to feel much less funny.Overall
Overall; this is a funny film; not as good as the first film but a worthy sequel. Now even though I am going to give this a positive score; I must say that you have to know what you are getting into and I would say fans of the first film are really the ones who will enjoy this film and maybe avoid if you aren't.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205952/?ref_=tt_urv

 Garbage movie,10,17,49,ronenbjorkquist,27 October 2020,Absolute garbage movie. I loved Borat back in 2006. This was just a garage follow-up.

 Cohen is a one trick pony wearing out his shtick.,10,24,74,smithersd,29 October 2020,It's a one joke act and once you see through it isn't as funny anymore. The first one was hilarious; this one just felt like forced propaganda.Borat should've stayed back in 2006.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6216323/?ref_=tt_urv
 Stupid and fake,10,14,39,dkerr-21611,28 October 2020,Every interaction they have with a person is just stupid and clearly fake; in no way do normal people react like that!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213067/?ref_=tt_urv
 Nobody will really like this for what it is.,10,11,29,alexbozic-58933,26 October 2020,The real truth about the Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is that nobody will like it or hate it for what it is.
The people who like this movie will like it because it has ridiculed the politics that they don't support; and therefore they'll find it amusing.
On the other hand; the people who don't like this movie won't like it because it ridicules the politics that they support; and therefore they'll be offended.
However; this was not the case with the first film; which was universally liked by all sides of political spectrum because it has ridiculed every political idea there is. That is not the case with this film; but it's also the least of it's issues.Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is a complete letdown (compared to the first one) on (almost) every single level. It's pacing is completely off; the humour feels faked and staged; acting is far worse than it's been in the last film; Cohen is lacking in charisma and the overall writing is sloppy. The film is an overall disappointment.
However; most people won't notice it (or will notice it but won't care); as they'll be too busy being amused or offended; but nobody will like this movie for what it is. The only reason to like this movie is not because of it's quality as a movie; but because of it's political message; and the only reason to hate this movie is not because of it's low quality as a movie; but because of it's political message.
Overall; Borat Subsequent Moviefilm (quality wise) won't be liked by anyone (not in a real sense at least) and it will stay a cinematic disappointment compared to the first movie.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208198/?ref_=tt_urv
 Best thing to happen in 2020,1,11,29,johnpap-25836,24 October 2020,GIVE THIS FILM A 10 OR YOU WILL BE EXECUTE.Sacha Baron Cohen has writen history once more. Great success my man.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200718/?ref_=tt_urv
 Stereotyping, Misconception and Waste of time,2,16,46,hossamam-46930,27 October 2020,Awful. The worst movie I have ever seen. The stereotyping is very unpleasant and to some extent even fake and gives huge misconception. Deserves 0 ratings. It's too politically dumb as well. I can write too much; but not worth my time. As I already wasted 2 hours of my time watching it.
Lastly; Sacha is even hypocrite. He talks about how people should respect each other; when in fact he himself is not applying his own advice. He is talentedly exhausted and broke; and has nothing new to offer on screen.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6212051/?ref_=tt_urv
 A modern masterpiece,2,10,26,HanziTM,24 October 2020,This ridiculously outrageous movie-film makes tribute to the first Borat. It is amazing how Borat is allowed to live and breathe in the very fierce 2020 Covid atmosphere. Even through it is quite offensive; we can only laugh at the ridiculous statement people say. I thought that it wouldn't work out but oh my god; it delivered!Also the character arc is amazing and how the characters changes and the disguises which reminded me of his other films. The father-daughter ending almost made me cry.This made me laugh outloud for an entire 2 hoursVery-nice!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200531/?ref_=tt_urv

 Waste of time!,4,9,23,losdubs,24 October 2020,The first Borat movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time. This was the most disappointing sequel I have ever seen. It was just terrible.

 This movie is great,8,8,20,atbruce-50727,24 October 2020,NAHT.What made the first Borat great was the authenticity of it. Borat felt like a real person coming to America and divulging in the culture for the first time. This movie feels more like watching an SNL member do a terrible impression of Borat than it feels like Borat himself. At least with the former there can be some humor residing in the satire of it all. This movie is like listening to that kid you went to high school with do a poor rendition of the Borat voice for the 100th time. And we all know how pleasurable that was.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201098/?ref_=tt_urv
 Best Movie 2020,10,8,20,kamennik,24 October 2020,It's hilarious; but I was really moved by the daughter-father story. Maria Bakalova is a star. Anyway.

 Biased Anti-Trump trash,10,13,37,jacobaalampour,1 November 2020,I couldn't care less if he made fun of Republicans; The original BORAT was hilarious. But this movie is clearly just a big ok smear campaign for the left. It's just an hour and a half of BORAT Virtue Signaling to you how stupid Pro Trumpers are.

 Polarizing reviews,5,7,17,nezbit27,26 October 2020,Apparently everyone now rated movies based on their political view now too. It's funny; it's satire.

 A 2020 treat, even if its not on par with the original,2,4,8,eddie_baggins,1 November 2020,2020 hasn't given us many surprises of the treat variety but one of the years nicest additions was the shock announcement that a new Borat film was on its way for our viewing needs and that it would be coming straight into our lounge-rooms for added Covid-related ease.The original 2006 outing of everyone's favorite Kazakhstan based journalist was a world-wide box office and critical smash and remains to this day some of the best work of its star Sacha Baron Cohen and its nice to know that while not as surprising or engaging this time around; Borat Subsequent Moviefilm (just one of the films many titles) is still at times just as offensive; funny; insightful and even oddly moving this time around.Understandably suffering from the fact these 14 years on from the first film have allowed many unsuspecting citizens to gain knowledge of who Borat is and who Cohen is in turn; Moviefilm doesn't have the same gold found in random encounters Borat has on his journey back to the USA to give a gift to a powerful politician with his daughter Tutar (played by game newcomer Maria Bakalova) in toe and the film does feel more staged and scripted than its more on the fly predecessor.It's not to say the film doesn't have some great moments that feel like they could never have been planned better (Borat's friendship with some Democrat hating citizens or appearance at a Mike Pence talk some such moments) but you can't escape the feeling that Moviefilm doesn't have the same natural charm as the 2006 original despite the engaging and committed central duo working wonders in their roles.Having lived as the character for various parts of his career; Cohen is an old-hat at such a Borat flavored outing and shines no matter the mask he dons or disguise he wears and much like Azamat Bagatov before her Tutar is a great new addition to the Borat cinematic world and Maria Bakalova gets some seriously funny moments to work her magic and even deliver a great message along the way as Tutar discovers that women can in fact drive cars and sleep outside of cages.Watching two such engaging performances ensures Movefilm is entertaining throughout; it doesn't help the films cause however of failing to live up to the legacy of the first Borat film and a sense that Cohen sometimes focuses on easy targets and even at times fails to bring out much comedic gold from his subjects despite his best efforts; ensures that this is a funny and watchable addition to the Borat cannon but not an overly memorable one.Final Say -In a year of disappointments its nice to know that Borat and his journalistic integrity is still intact and while Moviefilm isn't up too par with the beloved original; there's still enough laughs and insights to make this topical film worthwhile.3 cupcakes out of 5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6228062/?ref_=tt_urv
 Loved the first one...,3,4,8,elgrampo77,25 October 2020,...and Even though you probably should not compare the two movies; you still do. A couple of really funny and/or unbelievable scenes but most of it trying to be a normal comedy movie.
Probably would not watch a third one.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206562/?ref_=tt_urv
 You gotta give Cohen credit...,7,4,8,sblrr,24 October 2020,This Brit can make some of the wackiest stuff! I thought parts of it were hysterical and others cringeworthy.PS> my partner only give it a 1 or 2 and said that's time gone from their life.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203233/?ref_=tt_urv
 Boring,8,12,34,figueiredoalexandre,30 October 2020,I was counting the days to watch Borat 2 as I was thinking it would be as good as Borat 1. How wrong I was... Borat 2 is boring to death. I was watching it lying down on my couch and I fell asleep halfway through the film.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6219304/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat 2,6,12,34,bickerstaffj,23 October 2020,Highly disappointed. There were some funny parts throughout the movie; but absolutely nothing compared to the humor in the original Borat. The real life bits weren't nearly as funny; I found the daughter to be somewhat annoying; and the scripted parts ruined the movie as a whole. The original Borat was genius; one of the best comedy movies; arguably; of all time. This... was nowhere near. This was a missed chance at a great sequel.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198647/?ref_=tt_urv
 Politics aside, very weak successor to the first Borat movie,4,6,14,narim-kim,27 October 2020,Saw the original Borat when I was a student in Canada.(by the way; I am a "legal alien" visa holder in the US; so have no voting rights and no party affiliation)Absolutely loved the original Borat in 2006 and it remained as one of the best mockumentary/ comedy film upto this point (will be so forever more)So now I am married; and my wife never saw the original Borat;
And we saw that AMAZON PRIME VIDEO has both the original and the new sequel available for free; so we decided to make it a movie night and see both chronologically.My wife was absolutely amused with the original Borat and it was the 3rd/4th time viewing it for me and I still loved it.Then we saw this Borat sequel (Subsequent Moviefilm) the very next day;
and I can directly say this sequel is a total trash from beginning to end. It felt they had to rush through the production..it was not as meticulously crafted like the first Borat film; and political argument made in this film is also not as convincing as it could have been. I am giving only two stars for the actress who plays the daughter.Maybe the worst movie that I saw in 2020 (and believe me; I saw a lot of movies because of the lockdown),https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6214003/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not as good as the first one.,7,6,14,orr-54393,25 October 2020,There is a reason this went right to Amazon. We seen the first Borat at a movie theater and everyone was laughing from start to finish. This movie was not funny but just gross.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203621/?ref_=tt_urv
 Same old Borat,9,6,14,BrBaFett,24 October 2020,Same old Borat... which is a very good thing.I mean the only scene I disliked and cringed at was the father-daughter dance; but I laughed so hard at all the jokes about the US President... I forget his name -- just kidding I know what it is; in case republican read this. But what struck me the most was how much of a political move this was to make this movie; but raised eyebrows for me as well. I think I'm mostly entertained at the fact Sasha Baron Cohen is the best and most dedicated troll on Earth that doesn't care about who he pisses off; as long as his own mission is complete and goals are reached.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200692/?ref_=tt_urv
 A Pleasant Surprise,6,6,14,nick-rohner96,23 October 2020,A sequel is dangerous territory... All too often; they reek of money grubbing film execs trying to wring out every last penny from the corpse of what was once a successful and lauded movie franchise.Sure; you have your success stories - your Godfather 2's; your Lord of the Rings Two Towers'; your Shrek 2's. But for every sequel that has hit... five others have flopped. Who could forget the cinematic travesties that were Jaws: The Revenge; Paul Blart Mall Cop 2; and Troll 2. This scared me.You see; I loved the original Borat. It was one of my favorite comedies growing up and still is to this day. I did not want to see this films legacy tarnished by a corporate cash grab! For surely that must be what this sequel was... right?Wrong. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm was the hardest I've laughed at a movie all year. It managed the difficult task of staying fresh and clever without straying too far from the intent of the original. The addition of Borat's daughter; Tutar Sagdiyev; as a prominent character helps put a new and interesting angle on the hilarious yet cringeworthy situations that Borat so regularly finds himself in.This movie only bolsters the legacy of Borat and Sacha Baron Cohen and avoids the pitfalls which other follow up films so frequently fall prey to.8/10 - one of the few good things to come from 2020,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200116/?ref_=tt_urv
 Overall ok,7,5,11,pelt-38524,29 October 2020,Fairly disappointed I did expect more; but still very funny at times,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6216011/?ref_=tt_urv
 I mean it was alright,10,5,11,playsgmod,25 October 2020,A really rushed movie that was clearly made to make people not to vote for trump thats it. Laughed maybe once or twice but the problem was that it had the same jokes which was the daughter being dumb and learning stuff and that was just really boring. I understand why they made this movie but was it really necessary?,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206787/?ref_=tt_urv
 It's what you expect,7,5,11,hudakp-56680,24 October 2020,If you liked the first Borat; you'll like this one as well.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203115/?ref_=tt_urv
 Brilliant,1,5,11,fliss_chris,24 October 2020,I was so worried this film was going to be a disappointment after the genius of the first movie but I needn't worried. Another brilliantly; hilarious experience. Loved it!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203112/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not as bad as some people are saying,3,5,11,blacklabelkk,24 October 2020,The characters here absolutely make the movie. The movie itself is not that good... most of the time I was waiting for the next ridiculous thing the daughter or Borat were going to do and say. They hit a goldmine here with the characters..Now for the bad... it just wasn't very funny. Entertainingly funny would be a better way to describe it. I never really laughed uncontrollably like a really funny normally will make me do... but I did chuckle out of amusement quite a bit and for that I enjoyed it regardless of whether it was genuinely funny or not. It also appeared to be quite scripted and the ending where his daughter turns Kazakhstan into a feminist country was a bit awkward and it wasn't until that moment I felt like there was some kind of political agenda behind this movie; despite it obviously pushing a female focused lead actress into the forefront in a movie about a woman finding her own power etc... it in a way; was done really well for the sort of social justice/feminist/leftist theme this movie was clearly trying to go for.All in all; if you just want to be entertained by a new Borat character that is every bit as worthy as Borat himself; you should watch this. The female actress is fantastic and possibly made the movie for me. We'll be seeing a lot more of her for sure; she is very talented.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200543/?ref_=tt_urv
 Funny at times, previous are better,10,5,11,samjlopes,23 October 2020,Clearly too many people already know Borat. Funny movie at times but no longer scandalous as before. Donald Trump and Co. are the new target. Perfect movie for Joe Biden's campaign.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200120/?ref_=tt_urv
 Eyewateringly hilarious.,9,5,11,nhoddy-19958,23 October 2020,Just watched on Amazon Prime. I'm in my mid sixties and cringing; hooting and laughing all at the same time. Greatest respect to Sasha; the cast and crew. I think that this is better than the original. How does he get away with it??!! 10/10!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199826/?ref_=tt_urv
 Stupid, dumb, tasteless and funny as hell,1,5,11,robert-62387-55435,23 October 2020,If you like absolute silliness; outrageous behavior and total insanity; this is the film for you. True to the Borat style; where reality and fiction meet. It was dull in some parts and so funny in others that you will gag laughing. And as always; totally edgy plot lines for each scene.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199635/?ref_=tt_urv
 Cringey leftist desperation.,10,20,64,vwmatt,30 October 2020,Its a attempted smear campaign towards Republicans and that is litterally all it is.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6219826/?ref_=tt_urv
 Low energy,4,13,38,erik-25266,26 October 2020,Sacha felt tired and out of energy. The jokes didn't pack a punch as in the first Borat movie. I ended up stopping half way through with no desire to watch the other half.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208757/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borats back!!!,6,13,38,jimmyhambleton,23 October 2020,Absolutely brilliant sequel; great to have borat back and some of the scenes with his daughter are great who is also superb. Highly recommended. High Five🤚,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198554/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious,7,16,49,mohseniarian,23 October 2020,A great addition and resolution to the first film. It delivered in ways that still felt original while still being incredibly funny. For those stating that it's degrading women; are missing the point (and subject) of the majority of the film. If you feel this way I highly recommend you rewatch it and understand who exactly the film is making fun of.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197771/?ref_=tt_urv
 Purely awful,8,9,24,krasimirtodorov,27 October 2020,It is a disgusting; repulsive slop of a movie.
Totally unbelieveable that it is all a series of "hidden cam" pranks; feels scripted all the way.
Just not worth your time watching it.
It is also offensive how he speaks polish-kazkh made-up language; his daughter speaks in bulgarian and I watched it with Amazon's official subtitles that at certain moments don't have anything to do with what she's saying. It is basically like they told her talk whatever you want no one will understand you anyway. The humor in this thing is deprived of any taste.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6211706/?ref_=tt_urv
 "Sacha Baron Cohen is a talented actor" is an understatement,1,9,24,entropy_less,23 October 2020,His movies are a gold standard when it comes to real social experiments used in movies... And exposes the ugly primal instincts of people... Great movie,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199488/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not as good as first one.,2,12,35,findam,28 October 2020,Big fan of Borat. Thought the first movie was brilliant but this was just slow and boring.with only a few good sketches.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213751/?ref_=tt_urv
 Very NIIICE, but a little disappointing,1,2,3,jonahhenry-89032,28 October 2020,This is a very funny movie; but I don't think it lives up to the first one. I really like how Borat's relationship with his daughter grows though.The girl who plays Borat's daughter is a great actress. I hope her career skyrockets because of this.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6212272/?ref_=tt_urv

 Exceeded my expectations.,1,2,3,tylernjazz,23 October 2020,This is more than a hilarious comedy. This exposes the racist and intolerant underbelly of America; possibly more effectively than the original film.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197878/?ref_=tt_urv

 A watered down and boring movie,1,8,21,brunomb-59206,4 November 2020,Imagine the first Borat. Now take away everything you enjoyed from the film; like the sketches with real people and shock humor and replace it with political propaganda and obviously scripted/paid actors. That's basically what Borat 2 is.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6234947/?ref_=tt_urv
 Pathetic Movie,4,8,21,jack-alfandary,3 November 2020,One of the worst movie ever. Really bad humor or lack there of,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6233508/?ref_=tt_urv
 Very Timely Takedowns,4,8,21,vanwettering,25 October 2020,Low ratings must be from the takedown targets of the movie. I dont think they would really watch it though.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204036/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hot garbage,8,10,28,dlow-20825,3 November 2020,I'm a big fan of Eric Andre and Frank Hassle kinda stuff; I know it's dumb; but at least there are some laughs to be had. The jokes were so dry and stupid I didn't crack a smile the entire time. It just seems like he was trying way too hard to be funny so it just had the opposite effect. Combine that with all of the propaganda doo doo and it's basically just a massive waste of time.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6232655/?ref_=tt_urv
 pathetic,1,17,54,hecate21,27 October 2020,Not funny at all. it's a very lame repetition of the original.... don't waste your time.
Angry liberal trying to score points among other angry liberals. It's not original or not funny anymore. Humor should be beyond that....,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6209868/?ref_=tt_urv

 Very political, very controversial but lacks comedy.,10,1,1,pazortegaandrade,8 November 2020,Watching what he has done in the past. This movie just tackles and gets into the political part more than anything; which it was a dissapointment.Is worth watching if you wanna know what people were talking for a brief moment before the elections of 2020; but that's about it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6246906/?ref_=tt_urv
 First 45 minutes was funny,4,1,1,milestoempty,8 November 2020,After the first 45 minutes it was trash. The first movie was pure genius. This is just anti American nonsense.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6246487/?ref_=tt_urv
 flawed, vulgar, and i laughed until i cried LOL,4,11,32,krish_critic,23 October 2020,It was kind of a political expose as he pranked Mike Pence and Rudy Giuliani.
Rudy had a compromising scene in a hotel room with borat's daughter which might raise some moral questions.I cried till my stomach hurt but I kinda liked the first Borat more because of the social experiments in that but this is a MUST WATCH if u can take some offensive jokes which I'm sure u can lmao.*there is a cameo of T_m H_nks*,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198502/?ref_=tt_urv
 Long gone are the days of golden age Sacha Baron Cohen,2,15,47,tkcsjzsf,26 October 2020,A comedy movie that isn't funny is like a romantic movie without a love story. This has failed on every level of "comedy"; don't waste your time watching it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6209364/?ref_=tt_urv
 Waste of time and Money.,10,16,51,rytyrrell,29 October 2020,Well; there's 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Slow; boring; and not nearly as good as the first.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6215812/?ref_=tt_urv
 Comedic Mastery,10,7,18,alphawolfpack-25208,25 October 2020,There were so many occasions I began breaking out into fits of laughter and so many other moments of impulsive cringing. Unbelievably well done; we are so fortunate to have an artist like
Sacha Baron Cohen sharing his art with us.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204602/?ref_=tt_urv
 Kinda Funny mostly propaganda,10,7,18,ethansaylors,25 October 2020,There are some parts that will make you smile or laugh a little but most of it is political and not really that funny. Sequels are always worst than the first one and this was true for this sequel.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203875/?ref_=tt_urv
 Disappointment,9,7,18,rfriel-72385,24 October 2020,This movie was not funny and cringeworthy at times. Does not come close to original.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201938/?ref_=tt_urv
 Boring, unfunny, and way too much (bad)plot.,6,7,18,maxwelloreocookie,24 October 2020,Love it or hate it; the first Borat movie is a modern classic. We may get annoyed by the bad impressions people constantly do of Borat; but I still find the first movie brilliant. Obviously it's very rare for sequel to be as good as the original; let alone better; so my expectations for this wasn't that high; but damn; I wasn't expecting this movie to be this bad.First of all; this movie is way too heavy on plot and light on laughs. I may have only chuckled 2 or 3 times in the whole movie. As for the actual skits; none were even close to funny as classic as to the ones in the first movie and show.Mockumentaries like this don't need to be heavy on plot. The first Borat was super light on actual plot. The plot is just him learning and gathering information from America; but the real plot is just him trying to get sexy time with Pamela Anderson; and that's what makes it funny. Then from that basic plot we get a bunch of cleverly woven sketches from that; and the movie never came to a screeching halt when that plot showed up. Unlike this second movie; the plot of this movie is way too in your face; and it's not even a good plot; it's super cliché; overly sappy; and predictable. I knew exactly what was gunna happen right after seeing the daughter for the first time. Hell; I even knew what was gunna happen when they showed the daughter in the trailer. If you seen any cliché family movie ever; you will know what happens.As for the daughter; I guess she did a good job for what she had to work with; but she was still annoying to me. I know that's kinda the point that she's supposed to be annoying; but it still doesn't change the fact she annoyed me most the time; and her plot was boring and unfunny. I miss Azamat.Obviously I support women's rights and always have. I still support that message; but it was just executed horribly; because it was super unfunny and boring. A comedy is supposed to be funny and entertaining. Having a good message in a movie doesn't automatically make it good; and doesn't automatically make someone a bad person for not liking the movie itself. So I 100% support the message of the movie; but never want to see this boring unfunny movie again.As for politics; I don't care what which side of politics anyone is or what this movie is on. All I care about is if the movie is funny and good; which it isn't. But this movie movie is super preachy with it's side on politics. Where did this even come from? The first movie was nothing like this and just fun. What happened? I wouldn't mind the preachy politics and bad plot if the movie was actually funny; but it isn't.This is Sascha's worst movie by far; and I seen them all except for Brothers Grimsby. Borat 2 makes Bruno look like a masterpiece. Sacha Baron Cohen has lost his magic. Maybe's he's just too old now; who knows? All I know is that Borat 2 was horrendous. I'm very hard to offend; and Sashca's style has literally never offended me for real. It has nothing to do with if it's offensive or not; I just find the movie super unfunny and boring. To the people thumbing me down; I highly doubt you want to rewatch this movie over and over with friends like the first one. Do you? You are just thumbing me down cuz the movie supports your political views.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201657/?ref_=tt_urv
 Unique comedy not everyone can handle,4,7,18,irvinruizabc,24 October 2020,This movie goes much deeper than anything Hollywood is used to making. This takes the natural reactions and culture of the world not a make believe idea of American culture.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200722/?ref_=tt_urv
 chef's kiss,10,7,18,jokebroeckx,23 October 2020,Couldn't have wished for a better time for a Borat subsequent movie. love Cohen; love Maria; & love the blooming daughter-father bond. enough shock value to be a Borat movie; however; we all know the very real & necessary message of this movie;),https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199930/?ref_=tt_urv
 Great movie,1,7,18,leonlouis-45645,23 October 2020,Sad reality; made me laugh at the same time.
Hope to see other movies with Sasha soon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199924/?ref_=tt_urv
 Laughed out loud and grossed out, LOUD!,7,7,18,fingazmc,23 October 2020,I don't normally "lol" watching films on my own; just a smirk or slight titter; but this film really does have it's moments.
Sacha hasn't lost it and the lass playing his daughter (stunner btw) really fits into the character and seems to be able to ad-lib to further the hilarity whenever necessary.A LOT of people are gonna be annoyed by this film; but I'm English and I don't really have a political bias when it comes to America (or at all tbh) but if you're a Republican who CAN'T take a joke (or a snowflake as I think; the internet calls them); I really wouldn't watch.There were many other reasons to get offended (many of which; if I didn't enjoy taking the mick and having the same done to me and my views; religion or whatever it may be; I should not been offended by. But MAN UP; it's a film!!!) That I wont go into as I don't know how much has been released on trailers and talk shows.There's 1 major gross put moment which I'm sure a certain type of people might find liberating; (when you watch you'll understand the exact moment) that I found hilarious at the same time as disgusting; perfect combination...Just keep in mind this is Sacha Baron Cohen and this is what he does. And religion; political leaning or views on anything don't need to come into dislike what's funny and believe me; THIS IS FUNNY!So glad they managed to get this made even with the pandemic going on; one of the only positives to come out of 2020!!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199007/?ref_=tt_urv
 As expected,1,7,18,robh,23 October 2020,Not as good as his earlier movies. There are a couple of funny moments; but it's mostly humor based on grossing out the audience instead of deserving bigots and powerful fools being exposed and mocked. I much prefer the latter.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198062/?ref_=tt_urv
 Cringy,2,9,25,rfadam,24 October 2020,This movie had some funny moments but my memories of Borat from back in 2007 are more funny than how Borat actually was and is. Borat provided a lot of laughs back then,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200874/?ref_=tt_urv
 Phenomenal, relevant and funny as hell,4,9,25,gibbs-18172,24 October 2020,Can see the review scores being so varied on this; but what would you expect? This just shows the stupidity of not just repressed nations but the so called land of the free under the trump Republicans control.
Many laugh out loud moments for me; if you don't get this or are highly offended you are the problem in a 2020 world wanting to move forward into the 30s whilst preferring wanting to live in a 1620 world. In fact why are you even watching this? It's on Amazon go back to BBC 1 or CBS or ABC or whatever.Funniest film of 2020Sasha you've still got it and a great breakout performance from the lovely Maria Bakalova.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200773/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat ruined by left wing propaganda,4,12,36,teddakdag,30 October 2020,Horrible movie. Only a few laughs with the rest being a propaganda film. Not even borat,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6219674/?ref_=tt_urv
 Good to See you again Borat!,10,12,36,SupremeMovieKing,23 October 2020,Great to see Borat back in action; unfortunately the movie is notably worse than the original (is anyone really surprised?!). Still around a 7/10 and definitely Worth watching for those few classic Borat moments (not to mention the lack of any decent new content for months!); but overall it definitely could/should have been better. Not even as funny as Bruno but still had a few good laughs and better still; the nostalgia of when Borat ruled the world!!! I've been a fan since his original HBO show and I'm glad to see Borat still spreading his Hrum everywhere! Go in with lowish expectations and enjoy!!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197809/?ref_=tt_urv
 Embarrassing,8,13,40,musashinwari19,27 October 2020,I've no doubt Sacha Baron Cohen is a talented guy but this film!! I couldn't watch it all; it was awful; cringey and poor taste I turned it off after 15 minutes and that was too much! Absolute crap! I never stopped laughing at the first Borat film but didn't find this funny at all,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6210639/?ref_=tt_urv
 And non quality,9,6,15,javierpol,6 November 2020,People rating with 10; are you crazy or just trols.?Totally boring movie; poor quality and story.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6241374/?ref_=tt_urv
 Far from the first one,2,6,15,mahdikhaksar,26 October 2020,I didn't like it at all.
I am a big fan of first Borat but this one ruined my good memories from the first movie.
The main reason was that; the story of some one strange with American culture was already spoiled with first Borat; in fact Borat 2 was a fade version of the first one.
Also I believe the character of Borat's daughter wasn't a cool partner for Borat. In first Borat his colleague (Azamat) was an ideal character to complete Borat's character while the lack of this supporting character was obvious in the second.
Honestly; I was disappointed with second one while the first one was one of the best comedies I've seen.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207619/?ref_=tt_urv
 Is this all Fake ?,2,6,15,GoldenGooner04,25 October 2020,It's not filmed with a secret camera; so he has gone into all these interviews with these "Unhuman Monsters" with a cameraman? and its not hidden in a bag; as the camera moves round. I mean the cake shop; now the woman might have just been out for money; but she would not have done that on camera; as he shop would be finished which I would hope it now is,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205061/?ref_=tt_urv
 MY WIFE loved it.,10,6,15,ehamil-34602,25 October 2020,10/10 very NICE. A return to form with a wonderful addition of Tutar; Borat's daughter.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204438/?ref_=tt_urv
 The people give hope,10,6,15,rdkj1993,25 October 2020,Note there are some spoilers. Its important to recognize that to a degree this was or attempted to be a political commentary and as one it fell flat. The 3 major spots it hit on were 1. the pence/cpac scene. Opening is funny but the disdane and disgust on the face of pence showed it was an inappropriate and mistimed joke. 2. on the list is the rights rally and it stands to say in my research i found that there is actually a very large amount from that scene that didnt make it in the film. And finally 3. guiliani (its spelled wrong) unfortunately this scene is not a satire scene. Telling; disheartening and most of all disgusting but belongs more as a scandal and catch a creep than in a satire film.Now the good stuff. Despite politics the movie actually gives a lot of hope in the people of this country. The biggest part for me was the synagogue scene with the old lady. To have such a genuinely nice lady like that. She took cohen's character at face value and was nothing but polite and nice and even fed him. The same sentiment was felt with the 2 men who took him in during quarantine. Political opinions aside the reality is they took him in of their own free will and volition and helped out a person who needed a place to stay.In short when the research is done on the film it is even more heart warming to see some of the things in the film. And should be watched.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204240/?ref_=tt_urv
 Excellent,10,6,15,hawaiialin,25 October 2020,Tons of adult fun; and the real scenes with Pence and Giuliani take the cake. Brilliant in so many ways; politically motivated; and executed very well. Bravo...bine le ai facut.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204191/?ref_=tt_urv
 Total garbage,9,6,15,tswiftma-58423,25 October 2020,The original was offensive but funny. This movie is offensive and not funny. Totally degrading of women. Some people say that is the whole point of the movie but it's very strange to disgrade people to an unrealistic degree to make a point.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203810/?ref_=tt_urv
 Much weaker than first Borat,2,6,15,TomIsFilm,24 October 2020,Almost all of the interactions are clearly staged. It's transparent.Most of the attempts at humour seem designed primarily to serve a political agenda. So Baron-Cohen has gone from once daring comedian to political activist with comedy an afterthought.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203326/?ref_=tt_urv
 Brilliant film!,2,6,15,nibornamerof,24 October 2020,This is satire of the highest order. I haven't laughed that hard in quite sometime. Maria Bakalova is a complete revelation and (almost) steals the show. A 10 * movie.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203023/?ref_=tt_urv
 One of the funniest films I've ever seen,10,6,15,theminx46-863-405399,24 October 2020,Baron Cohen is a genius. Honestly this is one of the funniest films ever and just as good as the first one; if not better!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203002/?ref_=tt_urv
 thanks for picking this up Amazon,10,6,15,garyleeshaw,24 October 2020,Wow; made me laugh and not just a little bit; but full on laughing; I'd say its even better than the last film; thanks for Amazon for getting the movie in and it actually had subtitles lol.Borat needs to make more movies; I'd gladly pay £10 for each further movie on top of my subscription to watch decent stuff like this (as a one off payment each film).Borat exposes the real world here; he is real - his struggles are real.Seriously; give this man and tuta; a tv show; the world needs this happiness at this time.Tuta; nice play on letters there; Tatu -One last thing that would make Amazon perfect; grt rid of the d*rn adverts....,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202770/?ref_=tt_urv
 What's needed for our time,8,6,15,oliverloekke,23 October 2020,When I first saw the original Borat movie I thought it was amazing. This one is just equally good if not better at many points. Sascha Baron Cohen is a true artist when it comes to exsposing the true Nature of Modern society and he does it while maintaining a good and positive sense of humour. From the top politician to the well-manered family to the everyday delivery man who does not seem to be bothered by the fact that a human person is trapped within a box. He grabs the most essential problems today and showcases them in brutal but yet honest ways and he does not care. I'll guess that is what makes these movies so damn good.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199652/?ref_=tt_urv
 Disappointingly unfunny with a political agenda,10,8,22,Heavyd82,24 October 2020,I watched the original Borat when it first came out; and it was funny and vulgar at the same time. That being the case; I had a pretty good idea of what to expect in terms of the humor.What I didn't expect to see was one-sided political propaganda disguised as "comedy". Even if they were trying to get a message across; at least make it actually funny and authentic.The humor and scenes felt very forced; and it actually made me question how much of the footage was not staged. My guess is very little.I managed to watch the whole thing; and I think I slightly laughed once or twice the entire time.If you don't like republicans or Donald Trump then you'll enjoy this movie; but if you want to watch something that is actually funny you should not waste your time.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203300/?ref_=tt_urv
 Bad movie which has been rushed for the election,8,13,41,josefoygun,26 October 2020,The movie is extremely bad and exaggerated. It is so anti-trump that it is laughable; and also in perfect release for the election.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6209018/?ref_=tt_urv
 Can Borat save the 2020 election?!,10,16,53,virginiab3388,23 October 2020,Great success! Releasing this movie a week and a half before the election is comedic timing at its greatest! Super cringe at moments; hilarious at others; all around this movie film was amazing!! Hi five! Also; get out there and vote!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197792/?ref_=tt_urv
 Surprising funny,8,15,49,kulis-48575,23 October 2020,I didnt think this movie would be amazing so many years after the original but it was very very funny. I generally do not laugh out loud at movies but this had me going the whole way through. There was a lot of cringe so if you like that and the style of comedy of Borat 1 you'll love the sequel.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197879/?ref_=tt_urv
 Funny stuff,10,5,12,jhr2012,26 October 2020,A lot of it is silly; but overall; it's quite funny. The scene with Borat and his daughter dancing was both disgusting and funny. I imagine some people won't like it; and I can understand why; but I thought it was funny.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206981/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious!,7,5,12,scotty-mitchell,25 October 2020,Watched this with a few friends ans we were howling with laughter many times! You'll love it!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205950/?ref_=tt_urv
 Maria Bakalova is an impressive prankster in near own right, equal to Borat,1,5,12,julieshotmail,25 October 2020,The predecessor from 2006 is better; more authentic; and has a greater number of funny scenes. The context back then also makes you convinced how the interviewee would agree to have a camera around and would be OK being filmed. But this time; some scenes seem staged with "actors" in on the joke; like the scene with the "babysitter." If she's not an actress; how is a camera in that situation justified? At any rate; Maria Bakalova is the true revelation here. She can certainly hold her own; and her commitment is impressive. Notice how she doesn't hesitate to eat the lipstick; and then Borat immediately copies her; like "That is funny and brilliant. Let me be seen doing that too!",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204080/?ref_=tt_urv
 Home run again,1,5,12,tommyvall-1,25 October 2020,Borat keeps exposing the worst America has to offer; and if you don't that then the joke is probably about you!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203698/?ref_=tt_urv
 Lol!,1,5,12,luke-worlock,24 October 2020,Haha it must take some bottle to do those things 😂 really enjoyed it!Great watch!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203582/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious expose of misogyny and double standards,8,5,12,martinplatts-16482,24 October 2020,Funnier than the original because the US has changed and the film highlights this to brilliant comic effect.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203497/?ref_=tt_urv
 Very funny,1,5,12,mjsreg,23 October 2020,Sacha Baron Cohen's revival of our favourite Kazakh reporter is another stroke of genius; and Maria Bakalova adds to the fun as Borat's daughter; playing a brilliant role.Although not as racy as the first film (probably due to legal lessons learned) this is still typical Borat for the fans.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199933/?ref_=tt_urv
 Disgusting Liberal Propaganda,3,10,30,DMacLean15,3 November 2020,Sascha Baron Cohen has no problem caving to Hollyweird by going after Mike Pence or framing Rudy Giuliani before a major election but he would never have the stones to do a movie about Joe Biden and his corrupt family. The sequel falls flat on it's face in comparison to the original; a movie that I actually laughed at and enjoyed.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6232432/?ref_=tt_urv
 Yawn.,8,10,30,BWGrainy,31 October 2020,Typical over-the-top; childish; gutter soup ... as expected.
Not made for children but made for children.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6221397/?ref_=tt_urv
 So disappointing and beyond!,8,10,30,wivavog,30 October 2020,Well I was hoping for a fun movie. Similar to the first. Or even a continuation. Which he tried to do. But failed so on a epic level. Im still kind of shocked he would release this. I mean the story is garbage. The writing ; the casting ; the topics ; ect! Most of it is just off-putting and disgusting low level toilet humor. I knew what to expect and not to expect. Still I was shocked at just how absolutely awful this film is. I wanted to like it. But I cant give credit where its not due. In my opinion he could of done much better. Could of been such a funny film in a critical time. When the world needs laughter. Not more disappointment! I mean there's so many people that dont get paid. That could of made this opportunity. Way more enjoyable. That's sad considering were discussing veteran writers; comedians; actors and more. But lacks the passion of your average youtube sketch. It didn't seem like his heart or mind was in this project. Maybe it was ; who knows..... But personally I wouldn't recommend the 2nd Borat to anyone. The first had a large niche group. This movie was all over the place though. Most of the jokes. Are relying on shock value. Borat is well known now too. So he couldn't as easily interact with the public like before. Why he chose to put on the worst disguise and personality to evade that is beyond me. Wasn't funny ; just annoyingly stupid. A 15minute group discussion could of came up with a million better ideas. Then the girl...... Ugh.... Another parlor trick that worked out horribly. Now he has to make a 3rd one to return any of Borat's integrity. Sigh..... I know this guy is smart too. I just dont get it..... Like zero pride in this film. But who knows maybe he was highly restricted. But then why do it at all ? I wouldn't waste my time. But feel free.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6218998/?ref_=tt_urv
 2020's hero,2,10,30,alvintalavera,23 October 2020,With the return of Borat; I did not expect it to be entertaining but it prove me wrong. With this film; it has more meaning to it especially with family values. I love this a lot especially the twist at the end.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198097/?ref_=tt_urv
 Imitation of an imitation,1,7,19,denise-roman,25 October 2020,The original Borat was a good satire; a good imitation of reality; mostly traditional American; with a little Eastern European twist (the so-called Kazakhstan scenes were shot in a Roma village in Romania).I laughed; blushed; tried to stay cool most of the movie; although many times my common sense felt under attack. Ultimately; I decided to take the movie as an original parody.The "second" Borat now is an imitation of the first Borat. The imitation of an imitation fails because it tries to maintain a form; while losing its substance. The new Borat loosely reminded me of the risqué jokes of the original Borat; but with barely any genuinely fresh fun and with practically no new message. I wish this Borat imitation by Borat didn't happen; so the first Borat remained a valuable original.I gave a point for bringing up the theme of the Holocaust and having it inadvertently recognized. Thank you!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204213/?ref_=tt_urv
 More of a political campaing than humour.,1,7,19,mato-sto1,24 October 2020,First of; I am not even American. However I am a big fan of previous Borat.However; this movie fails to deliver the quality of an Ali-G Borat insert; let alone a Borat movie.It is too political at the price not having original humour. The Borat characther is rushed and it lacks geninue social interactions and awkward situations. The jokes seem all scrippted and not witful.Sometimes they are plain vulgar; with no other substance. (Di** pics)In general; this seems to me like a rushed out instrumentalization of Borat character for the purpose of benefiting the Democratic presidenal campaing.Which is IMO; a pity.Cheers,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201752/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat just outdid himself,5,11,34,evansego,23 October 2020,Wow! just when you think Borat couldn't get any more outrageous and bold he outdid himself in the biggest way possible. Is it better than the first one? Me personally no; but its still better than most of the movies that are playing out there.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198145/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hybrid comedy! Not to be missed??!,2,11,34,fullofteeth,23 October 2020,A true smorgasbord of comedic stylings!!! taming the pc and bold alike...very nearly making; truly; equal fun of all people. a full folly! all sorts of cringe an absurdly fascinating wow wow wow. damn.CONCEPTUAL AND EDITING GENIOUS!!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197931/?ref_=tt_urv
 regurgitated comedy,7,12,38,seger-34366,28 October 2020,Pointless and reputative. Nothing new or interesting overly political and boring,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6214598/?ref_=tt_urv
 Don't worth watching,10,12,38,alhashemiclan,28 October 2020,The most ridiculous; senseless; disgusting and pointless comedy I've ever seen. Couldn't watch more than 10 minutes of the movie. I hoped to enjoy a good comedy like The dictator; but was deeply disappointed.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6212759/?ref_=tt_urv
 Waste of time,9,12,38,kayehobbs,28 October 2020,Stupid; just stupid. Not worth my time. I watched to see what the big Giuliani thing was about; it as just him adjusting his pants. I can't believe that this movie got any good reviews; simply not funny,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6212755/?ref_=tt_urv
 5 stars for seeing Borat back again.,10,14,46,dickiehargreaves,23 October 2020,Its great seeing Borat return with a sequel but the jokes are a little forced this time around. Its OK ; just don't expect it to be as funny as the first.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197732/?ref_=tt_urv
 Joke Fails Second Time Around,1,13,42,artbreyfogle,29 October 2020,Movie flat and not funny...BUT Maria Bakalova is a fresh new star...Worth your time to see her in action...but dat's it...,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6215094/?ref_=tt_urv
 It had its moments,6,4,9,elliotjeory,26 October 2020,Some geniuine laughs in this; I respect Cohen is gutsy enough to make these kind of jokes whether staged or not. Although I didn't mind the daughter story line I felt like it would of been better if he was solo. Other sequels spring to mind where a daughter was introduced such as dumber and dumber to and jay and silent Bob: reboot; both which where very disappointing. Overall funny but can't compare to the first but still an overall decent film. I mean the moon dance come on....,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208406/?ref_=tt_urv
 Outrageous, cringeworthy, uneven, funny topical satire.,7,4,9,jdesando,23 October 2020,"I found a new book which only tells the truth. It's called Facebook. I learn so many facts there. Like; our nation's proudest moment; the Holocaust; never happened!" Tutar Sagdiyev (Maria Bakalova)From the 2006 film the fictional Kazakh TV journalist Borat returns after hard labor to descend upon the Trump administration; especially Pence and Giuliani. It's cringe comedy that doesn't always work (at times it's like a cold SNL opener); but when it does; it will delight the left and leave the right seeking blood (see Tutar's quote above).Borat plans to offer as a bribe his 15-year-old daughter; Tutar; to Pence; who he heard is so taken with women he dares not be with one ("I've got great news! Pence is speaking nearby... we'll gift you today!") More laughable is Borat crashing a CPAC meeting in a KKK costume ("I'm Steven Miller. Sorry I'm late.").Most outrageous is Tutar's real interview with Giuliani; who appears to be a willing sex partner until a Borat in drag bursts on the bedroom. Giuliani was not in on the hoax. (To Tutar after talking up the Chinese virus: "Ok. I will. I'll eat a bat with you." "You can give me your phone number and your address.") Oh; how the mighty have fallen.Borat has similarly outlandish but timely bits although among too many that fall flat. The failures frequently came from being forced satire; awkward in the execution and already too prevalent in our current pop culture (Thanks SNL) to be laughable any more. Besides now that the War on Terror has been upstaged by white nationalism and COVID-19; most are too exhausted to laugh; as necessary a remedy as it is.Cohen is a pre-eminent satirist of our time; even this less than great comedy is still funny and daring.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200062/?ref_=tt_urv
 Awesome!!!,7,8,23,jessmccartan-315-724128,24 October 2020,This movie is hilarious!!! Don't listen to the negative comments about the movie! It is just the Trumplicans are upset that they are being called out on their BS!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200637/?ref_=tt_urv
 Less crass, more heart,10,8,23,keezo9uno,23 October 2020,People will go see this movie expecting more of the LOL-inducing hijinx that Sasha Baron Cohen brings as Borat; but I hope they'll be pleasantly surprised by how much heart this sequel brings to the table. Much more plot-driven and emotional than its predecessor; maybe a tempering of expectations is needed but still a very fun and rewarding watch nonetheless.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198926/?ref_=tt_urv
 Absolutely brilliant,10,3,6,stlegera,7 November 2020,Sacha baron cohen is a comedy genius. If you don't laugh at this movie you're dead inside,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6244676/?ref_=tt_urv
 Would give 0 stars if I could,9,3,6,liat-ezchip,31 October 2020,Repulsive movie; lowest kind of humor possible. Don't waste 90 minutes of your time on this awful movie. I am genuinely surprised that Amazon even chose to be streaming it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6221513/?ref_=tt_urv
 It's alright over all,9,3,6,tylermorris30,26 October 2020,Nothing really bad about it; it never pulled me in and made me feel invested.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208346/?ref_=tt_urv
 He's still got it.,2,3,6,BA_Harrison,25 October 2020,Comedy sequels that come long after the original have a history of being pants: Blues Brothers 2000; Dumb and Dumber To; Anchorman 2; Zoolander 2; Bill & Ted Face The Music; to name a few. This belated follow up to Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006) could easily have followed suit; the novelty of the character and the format having worn off over the years; but while it's not quite as brilliant as the first film; there are still plenty of genuinely inspired; laugh out loud moments that make it worth a watch.I defy anyone not to bust a gut at the father/daughter dance scene at the debutante's ball; or be amazed at the sight of New York mayor Rudy Giuliani behaving rather inappropriately in the company of Borat's pretty daughter Tutar (a winning performance by Maria Bakalova). These two scenes alone qualify Borat star Sascha Baron Cohen as one of the most daring and original comedy talents of this millennium. Some of the gags don't quite hit the mark; and more of the scenes feel staged than in the original (although the more I research it; the more I am amazed to find was for real); but the good definitely outweighs the bad; with plenty of cutting satire and bold swipes at the Trump administration. Other highlights include Borat searching for porn at an electronics store; the visit to a pro-life clinic; Tutar explaining how she touched her vagin without having her hand bitten off; and Borat dressed as a Jew to visit a synagogue.7/10. Time will tell whether this one has the staying power of the first film (which I still find funny after several viewings).,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206305/?ref_=tt_urv
 growing up with Sacha Baron Cohen,4,3,6,fuljah,25 October 2020,I grew up with Sacha Baron Cohen characters.. it is very hard for me to watch him when he is not Ali G; Borat or Brüno.. When I was watching the Spy; i felt like he is gonna say high five any second and he will confess he was trolling us by playing Eli Cohen.. i get very anxious when he is out of chacter and trying something new..But i also know it is so tired now.. i mean everybody recognizes him.. i watched the movies 1000 times already.. i watched the Ali G VHS tapes so many times that they are squeaking in the video player..Despite all the negatives Borat 2 was very engaging and refreshing. I was jealous of the Bulgarian girl and did not want her in the movie at first.. but they blended in so well..i watched it in 1 go.. i did not stop it start doing something else and return back to it etc like i normally do..Borat 1 is stronger.. Borat 1 shows the American traversy very strongly.. Dilemmas of the culture; the stupid beliefs in the rural towns etc are better portrayed.. Borat 2 is lighter in terms of social commentary..That is why I give it a 7..i am shocked that people laugh at Borat.. I can only cynically smile.. How can they laugh at something that shows very strong; very radical social commentary??,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204882/?ref_=tt_urv
 Ratings helper.,2,10,31,austintmurphy,23 October 2020,Giving a 10; to plump the 1 star reviews by the Trump brigade.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199412/?ref_=tt_urv
 Masterpiece,3,10,31,lufreiheit,23 October 2020,I was not expecting this movie to be so good to be honest. I laughed out loud and I applaud everyone that was brave enough and so clever to make such an amazing movie in a time of need. Thanks!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198665/?ref_=tt_urv
 Timely and Entertaining (Except for Rudy),3,10,31,docnrse,23 October 2020,Not being a huge fan of the first Borat film; I was surprised to find myself laughing out loud so much for this sequel. It had more heart in it too. The relationship growth between Borat and his daughter Tutar was kind of sweet.I enjoyed being horrified by the extremely uncomfortable moments. All except the part regarding Rudy Giuliani. The Tutar character (Borat's daughter) poses as a reporter to interview "America's Mayor". She's nervous; awestruck; flirtatious; and the old man just ate that up. He kept reaching across to touch her hands to "reassure" her. He has no problem being led into a bedroom by her and even lays back on the bed to adjust something in his pants. Zero funny about that.Unlike all the other uncomfortable moments in the film; this part just angered and nauseated me. It wasn't rehearsed or fictional; and I guess that's the point. That was the Real Rudy. A creepy and lecherous monster. A definite skin-crawling scene.Seems like Sacha Baron Cohen has matured. He wrote a much better film that mixes the fictional characters with the real people in a more effective way. In the first Borat film; which I didn't hate; just wasn't keen on it; the character was obnoxious for obnoxiousness sake. This time around; there's a definite message.Oh yeah; and there are lots of gross-out moments; much to the amusement of the 13-year-old portion of my brain. I'll be repeat viewing.Watch for the Tom Hanks appearance - fantastic moment!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198322/?ref_=tt_urv
 Amazing satire,10,6,16,rui-ferraria,25 October 2020,Didn't laugh so hard with a movie for years; SBC it's an amazing actor and with humor tests the frailties of our society; giving us this masterpieces,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205975/?ref_=tt_urv
 Make Funny by Surprise Mr. Cohen,1,6,16,IndyTed,24 October 2020,Mr. Cohen gets laughs by embarrassing others in vulnerable moments. How about we find some special private moments in his life and set him up for embarrassment? How will he handle seeing himself or family members shamed? Make funny laugh laugh? A contest anyone?,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202872/?ref_=tt_urv
 Cringe fest!!,8,6,16,ashuj-89103,24 October 2020,Don't waste your time; It's not like the first one; just a massive cringe fest.... Its almost as if the movie was motivated by politics and not entertainment.
Sasha man; you can do better.....very disappointed.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202410/?ref_=tt_urv
 Painful the watch,5,6,16,sammekleijn,24 October 2020,I'm a huge fan of the first movie which I watched at least 5 times. This one however; is horrible. Nearly everything is scripted and full with "cheap" laughs. Feels like some kind of slapstick someone that likes Jeff Dunham would enjoy.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201365/?ref_=tt_urv
 Predictable Comedy,10,6,16,bonnenfantf,24 October 2020,Being a big fan of the first film; was very disappointed this time around. the shocking unexpected vulgar comedy that made up the success for the first production felt very unapparent in this sequel. The for shadowing of jokes was to upfront making a lot of the comedy predictable and less enjoyable whilst lacking the shocking surprise from a vulgar joke.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201125/?ref_=tt_urv
 Disappointing comedy,10,11,36,rovshan-g5,29 October 2020,I understand the fact that this movie got good reviews and high stars for the people it is against in government. But after all it is supposed to be a comedy movie. And as a comedy this is worse than average. Not funny except for few scenes. And people praise the acting; but there is nothing special about it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6215003/?ref_=tt_urv
 Jugsemach!,10,11,36,starwarsromania,23 October 2020,Funny. That's it;it's really f-king funny. Sasha is a beast.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198346/?ref_=tt_urv
 Stupid,10,10,32,mabbitfoo,31 October 2020,Hes still irrelevant and honestly alot of these people he treated this way lost their jobs after he conned them.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6221066/?ref_=tt_urv
 Just what we needed to save 2020 Borat!!!,3,10,32,Corkscrew84productions,23 October 2020,Going into this as a huge fan of the first one. I thought it would be a big let down but to my surprise it was on par with first one. While I do still like the first one a bit more. I liked the story and where they took Borat's character. Adding his daughter into the mix was hilarious and where they go with it I didn't see coming especially with Borat's character. Although a lot more this time around is scripted the non- scripted parts are still great but are no where near as close to the first. Although the moment with a political figure I don't see how that figure will comeback from this. All in all I was surprised with final film really funny while not topping the first I think IMO its not to far behind the first easy 8/10. Also shout out to amazon for releasing it early.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197856/?ref_=tt_urv
 Expected more,9,5,13,harrylt,27 October 2020,I loved the first Borat film and the sketches from Da Ali G show; but I don't feel the same about this movie. The first Borat movie had me in stitches throughout the whole film; this one didn't. There were parts that were funny; but there were also parts that weren't and kinda felt like the same joke gets dragged on.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6211784/?ref_=tt_urv
 Great successor to the first film,1,5,13,sanzoshady,26 October 2020,Very funny and entertaining. Love the Borat Film the first time and this time it was just as good and definitely lived up to my expectations. Just love Sacha Baron Cohen.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207810/?ref_=tt_urv
 A work of genius!,1,5,13,voodoothatyoodoo,26 October 2020,It is as good as the first movie; possibly better! It was the funniest movie I've seen in ages; and it was exactly what I needed during this dark time in world history.There are 2 kinds of people in this world. There are people who actually have a sense of humor; and will find this crazy; insanely funny.Then there are people with no sense of humor.It is as simple as that!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207365/?ref_=tt_urv
 Teriffic,1,5,13,scriibe,25 October 2020,Sacha Baron Cohen is in fine form and Maria Bakalova is a discovery. The two provide an uncommon depth to the movie--two people brainwashed by a nationalistic; puritanical regime (sound familiar?) realizing the truth. The faux abortion sequence is hilarious. And their learning the truths shows people can learn from their mistakes and become better people. MAGA folk; not known for their sense of humor will be offended but most people will have more than a few laughs.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205832/?ref_=tt_urv
 Legendary,5,5,13,minimal-tech,24 October 2020,Made this 2020 less miserable. I adore Sacha's humor. This is a masterpiece. Worth watching.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203059/?ref_=tt_urv
 Boring all the way through,9,5,13,diomavro,24 October 2020,The film was so mediocre that both me and my companion predicted that he must have gotten somebody in an awkward position after 20 minutes of movie time; in fact it's almost as if the whole film is structured around that one Rudy scene. In theory it's interesting that you catch a politician in an awkward position and instead of just releasing a the clip; you make a whole film around it. But in practice; the whole film is a chore; full of cringe and not funny moments. Sacha is clearly just a leftist who is triggered by Trump; and while this isn't a problem in itself; it's quite clear he can't express this in a very creative way; probably the worse thing he has made to date. It also seems to me that unlike the original Borat; a much higher proportion of people in the film are actors; and this kills a lot of the humor. I find it really quite strange that so many people revere who thrives on mocking humiliating people after lying and manipulating them to be in awkward position; at the very least it seemed like the harm was bounded when it wasn't political.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201452/?ref_=tt_urv
 Lots of subliminal 'truths', like many of SBC films!,10,5,13,jeremyhaydon,23 October 2020,Funny; silly; but wow; he gets those messages of truths out there; to the naive; Mainstream media swallowing masses; like the stuff about the PLandemic; vaccines; and how a 'certain nation' control the media; and the USA banking cartels!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199786/?ref_=tt_urv
 Demeaning,5,11,37,curtinleslie56,28 October 2020,There were no funny bits in this disgusting movie; and not in any way would I recommend it,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213069/?ref_=tt_urv
 Pass,1,14,50,andyedmonds,27 October 2020,Firstly WHY??? There was no need for a second movie. The first one was great; so innovative and so damn funny. This second one sorry just doesn't cut it. I think Cohen is relying too much on shock value rather than being genuinely clever and funny.There are some shocking moments again pushing the envelope but that's exactly what he wants obviously and that will get more viewers and raise publicity.I didn't laugh once.The daughter premise wasn't convincing although the actor was great the storyline was almost like she was an added extra and the awkward moments together didn't really work.Please don't make a third!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6209864/?ref_=tt_urv
 extremely bad movie,5,13,46,jovan-soskic,26 October 2020,I watched Borat I; interesting. A dictator; too. This; I don't know how to define. One of the worst movies of 2020; and there were some really bad ones.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6209173/?ref_=tt_urv
 Meh,2,6,17,rarepeperonis,23 October 2020,Not as funny as Borat 1 or Bruno even his America Tv Show.Only part worth it is the Giuliani prank. The rest of the movie is not that good or funny.The actress who play his daughter is very funny.Honestly if you manage to just see the Giuliani clip online the whole movie isn't worth it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200285/?ref_=tt_urv
 Good belly laughs wah wah wee wah,3,6,17,andybees,23 October 2020,I was excite. It was exactly what I expected. Good time. Very nice.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199887/?ref_=tt_urv
 Beautiful,10,6,17,rudayoub,23 October 2020,A genius display of current events.
Dont expect everyone to like this; if you know what I mean :),https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199825/?ref_=tt_urv
 It's fun,1,6,17,MooWoolf1,23 October 2020,I think many scenes were too short. They had more footage but for some reason many scenes were like cut in half. Also some seemed to be totally pointless and added nothing to the movie. The editing was just awful.The girl felt more natural to me. I don't say it was acting as it was not. Anybody can go out and do this; but only they do it. The people they interacted with felt like they were just bad actors. Especially the doctor.It was fun overall. The jewish and the singing part just killed me.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198788/?ref_=tt_urv
 Just an Anti-Trump movie,3,9,29,franciscoinchau,31 October 2020,They did this movie only for the elections. They attack Trump all time. The first one was different because they did a critique in different sectors. It's clear this is a anti Trum political movie.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6221286/?ref_=tt_urv
 Democrats propaganda,5,9,29,themickeyc,28 October 2020,Whilst it had some funny moments was not nearly as good as the first one and was EXTREMELY political with the timing of the release definitely not a coincidence - if as much time was spent on making a funny movie instead of promoting the democrats party by bagging out the republicans I'm sure it could have been hilarious however Hollywood with it's left wing agenda it was never going to be that way,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213312/?ref_=tt_urv
 Major disappointment,2,9,29,kasrarahimi-38824,28 October 2020,Not nearly as clever or funny as the first one. The singing at the hillbilly rally was funny but nothing else really.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6212427/?ref_=tt_urv
 Garbage,5,7,21,victorybazan,24 October 2020,Meh like three chuckles during the whole movie too political.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201909/?ref_=tt_urv
 Still laughing, what a legend SBC,10,7,21,floydbastable,23 October 2020,Couldn't wait to watch this and was not disappointed. Such a fan. At last a really entertaining film during this difficult time. Such a relief. He is such an amazing comedian. Very original; no one else even gets close. Very near the mark; snowflakes need not apply ha ha.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199661/?ref_=tt_urv
 Vulgar,10,12,42,jasondebly,27 October 2020,I liked The Dictator and the first Borat movie but this instalment is simply vulgar.Cohen is a talented comedian but fails to be one in this film. Rather than be witty he makes the most base jokes employing stereotypes that become stale almost immediately.I would like to see Cohen produce a film like Lost in Translation but maybe he is not capable.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6210557/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat fan...not this one...,5,11,38,smecara01,29 October 2020,Not even close to first Borat. Too much politics identity in this one...2 or 3 times I laugh. First 40-50 min looks lika a lifetime; not funny at all...,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6214723/?ref_=tt_urv
 Slightly funny, not as good as the first,7,11,38,hunterstalented,23 October 2020,Borat is back. This sequel is good but just not like the first one. There a definitely some funny parts; but I found myself cringing and looking away for a lot of the movie. Very political as well.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197756/?ref_=tt_urv
 Sympathy,8,10,34,flamingo-97597,28 October 2020,This was a chore to finish watching! I feel sorry for this guy! This character is all he can do? It's not even funny anymore just stupid! I'm glad I didn't pay to see this.
Total waste of time!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213494/?ref_=tt_urv
 Let's be honest if this was making fun of Joe Biden it would be trashed everywhere.,6,4,10,BillyBeefcake,26 October 2020,I watched it. I thought it was funny at times; but it pales in comparison to the masterpiece that was the first film.The mocumentary aspect of the first film is completely lost here; and it is just a structured movie like Bruno was.Bottom line; if this was about Joe Biden the critics would be giving it 5/10's as well. The only reason it is getting "rave" reviews is because it is about Donald Trump and those that associate with the Republican party.Is it worth a watch? Sure. I was entertained but outside of that it is one time watch for me.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207350/?ref_=tt_urv
 Truly magnificent,8,4,10,imdb-13900,25 October 2020,Just when you thought it was impossible to represent the US Republican "alt-right" community as any more absurd prejudiced and irrational than they choose to present themselves; in comes Sasha Baron Cohen in a series of exquisitely crafted "set up" mock interviews with "real life" participants.
By using the twinned barrelled foils of flattery; and apparent ignorance; he skilfully manages to expose the irrationality and inconsistencies of the current Trump administration and their supporters.
A great deal of effort has been made to sandwich carefully written "backstories" along with exquisite editing to create a strangely compelling narrative; worthy of the best "screwball" comedies; yet remaining overwhelmingly unsettling because it features "real words; from real talking heads"
On many occasions the transition from "made up" to "real life" clips is entirely seamless - situations are clearly taken out of context; and doubtless we only get to see the "best bits" but nonetheless it's genuinely funny; and on occasions; excruciatingly uncomfortable.
Make no mistake; Cohen doesn't pull any punches; there is no attempt at "balancing" his argument; clearly there are scenes where they use actors who are "in on the joke" from the start and at others; it's only apparent in retrospect this must have been the case. Nevertheless; he makes a point; and makes a point well; that people should always challenge accepted norms; and the first thing you should ask is "exactly what does this person stand for; and why does that benefit us".
One of the great joys of this movie is that it's "bang up to the minute" - not only does it reflect the current US political agenda; it has in many ways contributed to that discourse.
It's rude; bawdy; and on occasions; deliberately revolting. I very nearly pressed the >> button a couple of times; but was immediately glad I didn't.
I found it immensely enjoyable; if you don't; you should take a long hard look at yourself; and question whether you're precisely one of the people he tries to satirise.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206898/?ref_=tt_urv
 Really great!,2,4,10,fth_morgan,25 October 2020,It was the movie we needed right now. It had a lot of heart and was different from the first Borat film but none the less great!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203756/?ref_=tt_urv
 It wasn't bad,1,4,10,mikejpilch,23 October 2020,I found the first 20 minutes funny. The rest was a bit forced. Trouble is that Borat is quite recognisable these days so you lose the illusion that it is not staged even though everything is... And that is a big problem with this film for me as it's just too bogus.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199804/?ref_=tt_urv
 Spot on as usual,3,4,10,henrik-13637,23 October 2020,I dont think so many people in the US and A would be so offended by this movie. Last 4 years just proved that Americans tolerate differences to a point it gets All of us to laugh over the stupidity.I loved the movie.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199729/?ref_=tt_urv
 A good follow up - Although more of an agenda this time around,7,4,10,cjakub01,23 October 2020,I thought it was a strong movie for Baron-Cohen fans and the left will love it and be frustrated by it in equal measures. Still lots of laugh out loud moments and a couple of very potent cringe scenes. There were also a couple of scenes of genuine humanity to balance it out that I found the first movie lacked.Maria Bakalova completely steals every scene she is in and is an absolute treasure. I expect big things from her in the future.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199176/?ref_=tt_urv
 All in all its fun and unfair to compare to the first,1,4,10,carlgarethnorton,23 October 2020,I enjoyed this film but it was never going to have the same belly laughter as the first one. Much more scripted and forced.That said; it was still fun to watch. Sacha Baron Cohen never disappoints. The actress who plays his daughter did very well too.It was more like a buddy comedy than the original film which is in its own league,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198751/?ref_=tt_urv
 Very Nice!!,10,9,30,rich-80126,23 October 2020,This was very funny. You know what to expect going in. I laughed many times. I'd recommend this.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197857/?ref_=tt_urv
 Funny not!,10,13,48,dalobbyist,29 October 2020,There is nothing that produces even a chuckle. I only got through 45 minutes of this limp duck. The scenes are dragged out way too long and their premise is unimaginative. The fax 'sup' gag borders on torture. The monkey bit; really? I think the monkey is the only one laughing because it got out of the movie early.
This whole movie should have been a 5 minute skit on SNL; which is equally unfunny.
This seems to be only a vehicle for Cohen to wear disguises and boor people with no wit.
Maybe it got funny after 45 minutes but I won't be back to find out.
I gave it a two just for getting the movie produced in times of covid.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6216272/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not good,10,7,22,andrewab-53453,1 November 2020,People; don't waste your time watching this movie becouse it will be one bad decision; you will regret; I just lost twoo hour's from my life.
I never even see a movie so badly made; actor's; etc.
Why the hell this Director Mister Jason Woliner
will connect Kazakhstan with gipsy and romanian language; plus de virus Covit19. Only to a person that is has no brain will try to put something like this intro a movie. How this stupid movie even get financed...!!!This is absolutely shocking,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6226785/?ref_=tt_urv
 Vomit worthy gross out unpleasantness.,1,7,22,docmus-240-405250,24 October 2020,While there are a few laughs to be had in this concoction; the disgusting attempts at gross out shocks are not funny or clever or nice. Getting an actress to portray a fifteen year old girl doing a dance at a debutantes ball in which she lifts up her skirt to expose her menstrual bleeding crotch in front of stunned legitimate ball attenders is sick. If Sacha Baron Cohen is trying to satirise himself it might just pass; but as an expose of anyone else it fails miserably. Yuck!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201843/?ref_=tt_urv
 Crazy and not for every one.,2,7,22,Nemesis42,23 October 2020,Half of the comedy in this is great; half tasteless; stupid and not funny. However that's just me. To others it might be the opposite. Whoever you are; you'll get a laugh or two out of it. The actor playing his daughter; I hope she gets a bag load of work offers now. She is a good performer.Rudolph Giuliani made an appearance.
I think it's time to look up what the fallout has been on that one!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198338/?ref_=tt_urv
 You have to try your hardest to be able to make a garbage like this.,4,5,14,Kdosda_Hegen,7 November 2020,This movie was pathetic. Tons of dirty kindergarden level jokes. Just disgusting. Borat 1 was very funny; it used dark perverted jokes time to time to boost the feel of awkwardness and it felt very natural. Here it feels so forced and fake as if they tried to make it the cringest and most awkward movie ever. I'll admit laughed a bit twice or trice; but as a whole experience it was a torture to watch; I'm even embarrassed to admit I've made it though the whole film.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6243084/?ref_=tt_urv
 He's still got it!,10,5,14,westpointmajorette,26 October 2020,I stupidly had low expectations on this one. It was hard to believe that a Borat sequel could live up to the first but I was not disappointed. So funny. So original. He's still a comedic genius and you need to watch this film,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207591/?ref_=tt_urv
 Very niceee! What a great return!!,9,10,35,evgenycaruana,23 October 2020,What a return indeed!Such a great actor in my opinion; I was rolling with laughter!! It had those cringy yet hilarious moments in it that make you laugh out loud.I really appreciate how they portrayed it in such a way as to send a message which is in between the lines so to speak. That truth comes first; and through the spontaneous hilarious outbursts of Borat such secretive 'hush-hush' information is exposed to the public in a manner of ridicule! I enjoyed this one a bit more than the first one for sure!!Definitely deserves a 10/10 from me!!! Great job!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198115/?ref_=tt_urv
 Epic!!!,6,6,18,giesat,23 October 2020,To create something shocking nowadays is almost impossible and yet he DONE it.And please be offended; you should be.The lady in the film who took care of the daughter; hats off to her - a real person and what it seems a great one which should represent America if it's so great and not the guys with the guns.And one more thing; for those who will give a low rating; I'm sorry to disappoint but this hasn't been created for the ratings but to be seen and hopefully to open some people's eyes.Mr. Cohen; thank you ever so much for creating this; I thoroughly enjoyed it. Brilliant and EPIC!!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199758/?ref_=tt_urv
 Awful,3,14,54,michaelmcsweeney,29 October 2020,Complete waste of time; terrible. Liberal tripe. Struggled to watch it all and stay awake; took 3 attempts 8n the hope it might improve; it did not.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6216691/?ref_=tt_urv
 Don't waste your time,7,9,31,giticecream,28 October 2020,It wasn't funny at all. He talks in Hebrew. What's suppose to be funny was disgusting. Don't waste your time!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213361/?ref_=tt_urv
 Meh..,6,9,31,feagananna,28 October 2020,I laughed a few times; it was OK. First one was much better. The politics were too much; and pretty exaggerated. If your swing far left; sure you'll think it's funny; they'll laugh at any joke if it's making fun of Republicans.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6212706/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious,8,9,31,robert-thorburn80,23 October 2020,Sachs Baron Cohen is back as the legend Borat. It is offensive; crude but utterly hilarious especially the scene with his daughter after she swallows a baby on a cake; he takes to see if someone can take the baby out of her; after he says it was his fault the baby is in her
This is an upgrade on the last movie,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198467/?ref_=tt_urv
 Subsequently delivers,4,8,27,rogerglennkerr,23 October 2020,The introduction of the daughter made this sequel terrific. Fast paced with some classic scenes that would sit well within any episode of South Park. As funny as it could possibly get; this a sequel that comfortably matches the first movie,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198486/?ref_=tt_urv
 Conservatives Beware,2,3,7,tayman713,26 October 2020,Sequel to 2006's infamous phenomenon Borat; Sacha Baron Cohen returns to his iconic character to shine a light on U.S. politics. You will either be rolling on the floor in laughter throughout or cringing until well after the credits roll. Not an easy moviefilm to recommend to just anyone; but if you enjoyed the first Borat; you will find plenty of laughs here.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208407/?ref_=tt_urv
 Propaganda Film,1,3,7,twbqyympu,26 October 2020,Sadly; (and conveniently) released before America heads to the polls; this was nothing but a smear campaign at certain political figures/parties.
And; although it was funny at times; SBC's Borat character is washed up and just not as hilarious as he once was. Probably because everyone knows what to expect from Borat; taking the original Ali G/Bruno style comedy out of it.
It's worth a watch if you're a fan of Cohen's. However; if you're easily offended by dick and ball jokes; frequent images of male genitalia and anti-semitc banter; sit this one out as you'll just go all Ken and Karen.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207333/?ref_=tt_urv
 A (slightly) different approach,2,3,7,burnzyburns,26 October 2020,When Borat came out many moons ago i highly considered to be one of my all time favourite comedies especially that of the crude nature. A movie like that I could never picture it having a sequel but in 2020 where this year and it's few previous that have been decimated by sequels; I wasn't too surprised to see this being made and realeased.Borat "2" still sticks with the same formula of being off the wall; no limits style comedy. Unlike the first movie that doesn't follow much of a script or story and instead throws us into these completely ridiculous scenarios that amount to absolutely nothing other then poking fun at old country USA; Borat 2 actually has a plot. It involves Borat having to succeed his mission to lend a monkey named Johnny to Trump to make Borats country redeem itself. Of course; things don't go to plan.Borat 2 surrounds itself around Trump and COVID. How fitting and a win win for a crude comedy; right? Sort of. Instead of the original sidekick Azamat; we have Borat's daughter. I must admit; I really liked her. She's brave in her role and she's very funny at times and rarely annoying. I wasn't at any point truly skeptical. Borat; himself; has his moments. You'll pick and choose your favourite scenes from him and I mean he's really funny at times but at other times a bit dry with his humour and forced. Naturally I thought he would be hilarious but his daughter seems to make him look good when they're in scenes together. It was surprising.The ending isn't a grand conclusion of any kind but it reflects on Borats time in America; including scenes from his first appearance. It was a decent ending.You'll laugh and enjoy yourself. I don't think you'll remember this one forever but considering how poor comedies are now a days; this was one is well worth the watch.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207261/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat 2: Democrat,10,3,7,ricky_dry_county,25 October 2020,1) Has enough comedic moments. The female lead is quite refreshing & saves this film.
2) Doesn't take a single shot at the opposite side of the political spectrum. The current hyperprogressive hysteria has limitless potential for effective satire and would have actually been contrarian/edgy but Mr Cohen is actually more Bruno than Borat in real life.
3) The infamous Rudy Guiliani scene has some weird repetitive cuts from diffferent angles to make it seem like it's gone on for longer than it does. Whatever it is; it's certainly interesting and you've gotta give it to SBC for his rather unique brand of shock humor albeit point #2 sets this film back a few significant notches.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206679/?ref_=tt_urv
 Funny and not thaat bad.,10,3,7,fbdn91,25 October 2020,Yes some parts are extreme and annoying. But it's entertaining and funny,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205601/?ref_=tt_urv
 Democrats rate it 10, republicans rate it 1... so 4 stars from me,10,7,23,aurel-buzatu,1 November 2020,This would have been a masterpiece if it wasn't clearly politically biased.
If only this had mocked the other side just a little bit; it would have made it a great watch.
Even the release date is intended to make it a democrat propaganda material.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6227575/?ref_=tt_urv
 Cringeworthy at best!,7,10,37,bazz_64,26 October 2020,I loved the first one. New ideas; new takes on comedy; greatly timed jokes. This one was cringeworthy at best. I grinned once; that's it. Nothing new; just the same old recipe from the previous film - this time spiced with embarrassment. I respect Sacha Baron Cohen. I think his earlier work such as Ali G; Borat; Brüno and The Dictator has been great fun; but this is swing-and-a-miss. I don't see the point of it.
A waste of talent; a waste of time and a waste of money. I sincerely hope; he will create something applicable to his talent in the future. This is a mark on his otherwise great comedic competence and reputation.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208858/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not Funny,10,6,19,keeleylowe,1 November 2020,I loved Cohen's earlier work (Ali G; Borat; Bruno); but this fell way short. The move doesn't have the same feel as his earlier works and I can't say that I laughed a single time during the movie.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6226979/?ref_=tt_urv
 A Strained, Tired Embarrassment to All but the Most Left Inclined. Very Nice...Not!,1,6,19,jaredpahl,24 October 2020,Right; you've seen my rating; and you think you know what my problems with Borat 2 are. You think I'm one of those right wingers who badmouths any lefty circle jerk on principle alone. You're mistaken. I love Borat. The original film was a daring; unique; and crucially; uproariously funny mockumentary. I suppose the political aims of both the 2006 film and this new Borat picture are about the same; to shine a mocking light on those fat; backwards Americans by way of a really backwards Kazakhstani TV reporter. There was a sparkle of genius to Borat's first big screen outing; a satirical sharpness to compliment one of the funniest characters I had ever seen.The sequel... it's embarrassing. And not just because it regurgitates the same hackneyed Trumps jokes that induced groans three years ago. Borat 2 is also shockingly unfunny in the traditional sense. Its worst offense is the introduction of Borat's daughter; and by extension; a sappy father daughter bonding storyline that neutralizes the risqué edge the first Borat carried so well. Maria Bakalova is a terrible comedic actress; annoying; shrill; and obviously floundering in her attempts to curb Cohen's off the cuff improv style. She can't hack it; but the entire character is a huge dud. Borat's daughter comes across as some kind of focus-grouped feminine appeal token from the Cousin Oliver Writing School for Hacks Trying to Mix Things Up. She's so overwritten and obvious; there's just no joy in watching her up there on the screen. And the story suffers heartily in her wake. This film feels so much more scripted than its predecessor; unfolding into a tidy; predictable three-act road movie with some mockumentary interludes in between.And perhaps most disappointing of all is Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat. He doesn't seem to have it anymore. The voice doesn't sound right; the well-meaning enthusiasm is gone; and those quiet; subtle bits of brilliance are flatly abandoned. He's louder and broader than ever. It doesn't work.The spark of inspiration that first brought us Borat is long dead. This Subsequent Moviefilm is a straining; tired ordeal. It dutifully checks off each and every cardinal sin of a comedy sequel: clumsily trudging up jokes that worked before; introducing "fresh" new characters; playing bigger; going more obvious. Not only is Borat 2 stale; it's rotten. The idealogues will clap and nod along; and pretend that this is just as funny as ever. I thank God I am not one of those people. I don't have the energy to twist myself in knots defending this sub-SNL level piece of shieet.25/100,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202595/?ref_=tt_urv
 Brilliant!!!,1,6,19,bernierdan,23 October 2020,As always SBC finds a way for satire without being too heavy handed in directly insulting people. Maria is incredible in her role and can easily hold her own with Sasha which says A LOT!
For me the ending was my favorite part.
And bad boy Mr. Giuliani! 😂🤣,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199585/?ref_=tt_urv
 I didn't stop laughing amigos.,2,6,19,simelemontolomeo-56461,23 October 2020,The best movie I've seen this year. a great criticism of reality; especially the American way of life and its politicians. I'm surprised all those Trump supporters don't give it low marks.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199331/?ref_=tt_urv
 Bonkers,1,6,19,vishal-12218,23 October 2020,Anyone going into this thinking it wasn't a political movie needs to go watch the Princess Diaries.Well done Baron Cohen; well done on another incredible movie highlighting racism and prejudice.Highly recommend it as it's just 1 1/2 hrs of bonkers by Baron Cohen,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199184/?ref_=tt_urv
 Some very funny parts,7,6,19,RRomanino,23 October 2020,I laughed out loud at a handful of scenes. I laugh easily at this type of humor; and I know this.
I definitely felt uncomfortable; though; with that last interview. It probably goes too far. I cringed.
I get it; there are parts of this country that don't share the same views as the coasts. Some are downright scary when looked at with an evolved sense of humanity. But; to search them out and use them as a representation of a whole party is just flat wrong. You can do this for any group. I wish this movie was more fair and less focused on our politics here. Had these stunts been attempted on all people of varying ideologies you would have had the same results. There are plenty of gullible and flawed people from the diverse spectrum of beliefs out there.
I think SBC is better than this but still a comedic genius.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198106/?ref_=tt_urv
 Omg. What a hilarious movie. Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius,9,8,28,shankvijay,23 October 2020,Sequels are never the best; but this one is topping the charts Tutar is simply amazing it cannot get any better than this,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198694/?ref_=tt_urv
 what if.....,9,5,15,jwjtn,7 November 2020,What if you continued to belittle half your audience and pandered to less than half of the remainder? maybe boycotting all " entertainment " since 2016 is not a bad idea,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6242940/?ref_=tt_urv
 Crass and amateurish,8,5,15,netorius-75491,6 November 2020,I wasted 90 minutes watching this totally amateurish movie. Total waste of time. I guess if you thought the first movie was a 10; this will get a 5; so if you thought the first was a 5; this is a zero!
Don't waste a minute of your life watching this.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6241688/?ref_=tt_urv
 Poor poor poor!,10,5,15,sadiqahadi,24 October 2020,This is what happens when the first movie is a huge success; took much pressure on the second and yes it's a flop!They try to hard to make it funny; Borats jokes and timings are poor!First movie was a documentary style movie; this feels like a normal movie with a story which could be ok; but the acting and punchy jokes were missing.Sometimes just leave movies as they are and don't try and take advantage of all the hype,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201490/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat lost his way,6,4,11,rsallholbrow,3 November 2020,This film appears to have been made for the sole purpose of trying to influence the American election. It only goes after Trump supporters. I enjoyed the first Borat movie; but as everyone know about Borat now; it's obvious most scenes were scripted and not actual pranks. The movie comes off as racist and arrogant; while trying to appear that the movie is against racism and pushing diversity.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6233642/?ref_=tt_urv
 Good but disappointed with a key actor,9,4,11,ajsenerchia,27 October 2020,Film was funny. Really disappointed with Tom Hank's performance; though. You could tell his heart was never really in it. He left a lot to be desired. Tom's performance falls somewhere between Angels and Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016). Thomas is a rare taken; indeed; however his shortcomings were truly on display during this cinematic performance. All in and all; 7/10 stars.Oh and Rudy Giuliani touches himself at the end.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6211865/?ref_=tt_urv
 The best and only one true comedy of 2020!!,6,4,11,frenkymr,25 October 2020,Borat saves 2020 and the comedy genre! If you liked the first movie; you will love this one!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205679/?ref_=tt_urv
 Fantastically hilarious,6,4,11,kaslanyan,25 October 2020,It's tough for this movie to live up to the hype of the original which I loved so much but it does a pretty good job. I laughed so hard at times i thought I couldn't breathe. And there were moments of compassion that I wasn't expecting which gave some depth to the movie. Really great and definitely worth the watch. I mean Sacha is a genius and it was a masterpiece,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205464/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,2,4,11,marmar-69780,25 October 2020,Borat Subsequent Moviefilm was a worthy follow up to a first film and i can say that i am glad that this film didnt hold nothing back and it still keeped same style of humor that will offend many people ;but who cares about them;let them cry a river somewhere in a corner of their basements room.Sacha was great again as Borat and he keeped his style through entire film.His daughter was also very funny and she was a great addition to this film;she and Borat shared a lot of great moments together in which one they made fun of everything starting with politicians ;virus and other staff.Borat Subsequent Moviefilm was very funny film to me;not on level of first but still very good,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204906/?ref_=tt_urv
 YOU try making subsequent moviefilm in pandemic!,9,4,11,me-152-367769,25 October 2020,Funny movie. Some people say not funny like first one. You make movie in pandemic; then you allowed to judge. Perfect moviefilm to help swallow load of 2020! Very Nice!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203750/?ref_=tt_urv
 Meh,6,4,11,greatgintas,23 October 2020,Most of the movie was scripted unlike the the first one. Real reactions made the first movie so great and this one didnt have that feeling.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199387/?ref_=tt_urv
 Excellent sequel,3,2,4,jordandeanturner-45709,7 November 2020,Wow. Just as good as the first. Love the relationship between borat and his daughter. Such great chemistry equals so many laughs,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6244087/?ref_=tt_urv
 Well worth a watch,10,2,4,agmoldham,25 October 2020,It seems 2020 is going to be the year of watching movies at home; so this is my first 'home movie' review. One of the great things about comedies at the cinema is that you can hear what everyone else thinks of the movie. This is especially the case with a movie like Borat where some of the comedy is very subtle.Anyway overall the second Borat movie is an entertaining watch. At times you do wonder how politically correct some of the humour is; but comedy should push these boundaries. I suppose the stand out moment of the movie is the Rudy Giuliani scene which has got a lot of publicity. I'm sure this will have boosted the viewing figures and it doesn't look good. It seems his days of being regarded as one of the hero's of 9/11 are long behind.Whatever your thoughts are on the original Borat film you're pretty certain to feel the same way about this movie.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205499/?ref_=tt_urv
 An above average comedy movie with no added value for social commentary and satire like its predecessor,10,2,4,tanim-15042,24 October 2020,The first Borat is a timeless classic; you can watch that any time and laugh at the top class satire.
But this one is more of a comedy movie with great laughs here and there; but overall it's just a one time movie with almost no added value for it's social commentary or satire.
Still a good movie though.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201747/?ref_=tt_urv
 Uses deception and misinformation,8,0,0,sgbedell,9 November 2020,Haha. Uses deception and misinformation to sway an election. Nice...Just like Russia as the left wing cried. I'm not even a Trumpet/GOP fan; but he makes his left wing bias noticeable. His Bias is real to see; and I'm a registered independent. Borat is just a washed up Democrat hack now. Other then that. Movie was decent; but not like past before his left wing bias showed. He'll be washed up for a couple years; then you'll probably see another political hit job to rally cry his base. That's what crony capitalism is about. They will all suffer now; since trump bashing won't buy them clicks.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6251704/?ref_=tt_urv
 Amazon revives Baron Cohen's comedy icon to great effect,7,0,0,davideo-2,9 November 2020,STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningYears after he unwittingly caused his native country national humiliation; and was tortured by Premier Nazarbayev (Dani Popescu); Kazahkstani reporter Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is handed the chance to redeem himself; when the Ministry of Tourism once again sends him to America; to deliver a famed pet monkey to President Trump to smooth relations. However; upon his arrival; he discovers his daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalava) stowed away; and has eaten the monkey to survive. Borat; in his wisdom; decides she must be offered in place of the monkey; only to be taken on a journey of discovery.Nearly fifteen years ago; the original Borat film became a massive cult hit; on the back of the hilarity derived from a dim witted foreigner's unbelievably ridiculous cultural lack of awareness. However; the events of the last four years; with the election of Trump and the present coronavirus pandemic; have created an environment more mad than anything Borat himself could cause; and so a typically (in this day and age) belated sequel to the original film was just begging to be made.While Baron Cohen may have been trying to branch out into more serious dramatic fare in recent times; he will always be mainly associated with the comedy characters that made his name; of which Borat may be the most successful. Although it may feel more timely and relevant this time; debut feature length director Jason Woliner still follows the same formula that made the original work quite so well; with an unrelenting assault of outrageous; boundary pushing belly laughs; that may not come together and work quite as well as the original; but is certainly not far off it.Mainly; in these dark and uncertain times; one thing we all need more than anything is some humour and light; and the hilariously unaware Kazahkstani madman fits that bill just fine (and might shed some more light on it all than you might have thought. ) ****,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6251598/?ref_=tt_urv
 Cringe, laugh, Repeat,5,0,0,dantaylor-50374,9 November 2020,This was never going to be as good as the first one and SBC knows this as he addresses early on in the film that he would need a disguise as the character Borat is to well known to walk arould pranking the unsuspecting public. This is were his daughter ( Maria Bakalova ) comes in to play producing a sterling performance; matching her dad for cringe factor and showing that she has balls as big as SBC.It may not be the best film but In these crazy and sad times an hour and a half of Borat is just what the doctor ordered.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6251425/?ref_=tt_urv
 Tiring,3,0,0,djremotion,9 November 2020,After massive laugh attack of first Borat which imho was great; this second installment feels forced and unfunny from the get go. Storyline is rubbish; acting is bad and it all feels just so hastily glued that we found it to be tiring and barely funny at any point. At somepoint you forgot thinking if this or that scene was completely acted because it did not make you laugh regardless. There was of course the added weight of the political agenda that further made it feel tiring and forced effort. One of the worst movies I have seen in last 10 years.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6251013/?ref_=tt_urv
 Class,8,0,0,willwestley,9 November 2020,Genius - a proper laugh and not a disappointment in any way.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6250926/?ref_=tt_urv
 Can i give it a 100?,6,0,0,corneliusroz,9 November 2020,Sacha never fails to make you laugh or amaze. He's done it again here. Basically he trolled people and made a movie out of it showing true reactions and candid moments of it. And Maria baklova was an amazing edition here. Even though i wasn't sure anyone could match his spirit of character play which he takes it to extreme ways (which he did in this movie) she could do that too. In the recent interview sacha talked about choosing her from 500 candidates and she was given the script in UK and she has never been to US before yet did a mind-blowing job in the movie with her flawless acting and sacha was actually overshadowed by her performance which is crazy. If she doesn't get an Oscar it's gonna be a shame. Overall controversial and extremely funny and genuine documentary like movie.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6249863/?ref_=tt_urv
 Pure courage,6,0,0,didomenicosam,9 November 2020,I can watch a horror movie almost without flinching because I know it's not real. I can appreciate the art of it. But with this movie; nope. I cover my eyes as I see some of the REAL events unfold in front of me. I'm laughing but I'm horrified at the same time. How these guys pull off why they do takes courage. ALLOT of courage.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6249538/?ref_=tt_urv
 Satirical Reality show,8,0,0,Camerenth,9 November 2020,The appeal of this movie is the real moments that our characters find themselves in. This movie; as opposed to the first; actually had a story arc for Borat's daughter that is actually quite compelling at times. The shenanigans that come out of this movie are on point for a SBC flick. Though I will say the viral scene with Rudy G. Is not as controversial as social media might claim.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6247779/?ref_=tt_urv
 Just disappointing,5,0,0,jambothelambo,8 November 2020,I love Borat 1 and was extremely excited when they announced a second one but I was left disappointed. The jokes weren't on the same level as the first one and it felt like less risks were taken when filming daring scene for one joke. I think one of the main reasons for the downfall of this movie is that there was no Azamat as he was turned into a coach. The story was also really boring and wasn't nearly as stupid or exciting as the first movies. Borat should have gone to another country to learn from them instead of going back to America.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6247692/?ref_=tt_urv
 Out of touch,6,0,0,foltza-63499,8 November 2020,Favorite part: Babysitter Jeanise. Other than that; this movie didn't make me laugh and cringe like the first one did. My reaction to the movie was further solidified by the second-hand embarrassment I felt for Cohen in his interviews and how out of touch he is.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6247309/?ref_=tt_urv
 But...,1,0,0,Olwydd,8 November 2020,This is a great comedy on how divided people can become because of news media that is drawing their last breath. Neither the megalomaniac Trump nor sleepy Joe-strogan caused millions of deaths. Sasha being an a-hole outside of this movie is different from the one he portrayed in this movie.Politicians try their best to change people's view of this world to their own benefit. Some riot in the streets for a cause just as people with the same mindset spread their ideas online.Do these people really have such a huge effect on your life as is portrayed in the media? As an outsider nothing's changed about the USA except for a few tweaks to allow more people the freedom that others have. During the last 20 years mainstream media has become way more abusive than they should and social media giants are doing their best to add fuel to the fire for profit.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6247295/?ref_=tt_urv
 I expected something more,3,0,0,jane_austen79807,7 November 2020,Borat could have been much much better; it was like he was repeated the same jokes again and again; could have been much much better.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6244514/?ref_=tt_urv
 Very funny with some stupid comedy,2,0,0,aaurnab,3 November 2020,I love SCB; he is genius. But I found here he is trying to do some silly comedy. Always trying to be funny dragging unnecessary pervert activity. Felt disturb. Anyway the sarcasm was funny; enjoyed.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6232988/?ref_=tt_urv
 The sequel is actually slightly better than the original movie,4,0,0,fciocca,2 November 2020,Borat is back after more than 10 years since his original installment in 2006; and oh boy if it was funny. I think that this sequel was actually slightly better than the original movie; for sure I laughed more and I really appreciated Tutar; the daughter of Borat portrayed by Maria Bakalova. She was amazing and I genuinely think that she had the most funny jokes this time; her character has a progressive and interesting development. There is a special chemistry between the two main characters and I really like how their daughter-father relationship evolves. Both actors speak their native languages; Sacha I presume communicates in Yiddish; while Tutar I am sure speaks Bulgarian. It shouldn't be easy to coordinate during dialogues when you use two completely different languages; so good job.Compared to the previous movie; I think that almost every scene was prepared in advance. The first movie on some points looks more spontaneous and have this documentary-vibe; while in Borat 2 is heavily scripted and you lose in fact that mockumentary feeling. Maybe the only authentic scene was the one with Giuliani and Bakalova at the end of the movie; that is very controversial and so much discussed on the internet. A different approach to the script that I have personally appreciated. The movie is very actual; they managed to speak a little bit about the global pandemic and to make fun of conspiracy theories. Cohen is known for his controversial humor and he managed to joke about the current political; economical and social current situation in America.Borat is a political movie; but manages to be light-hearted and entertaining; I passed 90 amazing minutes by laughing and enjoying this sequel. The plot is simple and effective. Watch it if you want to have a funny evening; even better if you invite friends at home to watch it together; you will have really good time.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6231844/?ref_=tt_urv
 Heart was in the right place...,7,0,0,Med-Jasta,2 November 2020,But it was just okay. Not enough laughs and too much plot. The story was constantly shifting. At 20 minutes in I felt like I had seen a whole movie. And while I completely agree with the message it drove the story too much. And will probably be obsolete in like 2 years.If felt like they knew what message they wanted to say by didn't really have the right story or way to get it across. Or at least with all of their unscripted scenes they didn't really get what they were going for.The are a handful of good laughs in there but they're insurmountable compared to the first. Actually if this wasn't a sequel to one of the funniest movies ever I would have shut it off pretty early. I just kept waiting for great stuff and only got some.They were creative about how to disguise Borat. But ultimately I think this really took away from the movie. They didn't get the freedom to do what they did in the first movie and had to limit themselves. The comedy of disguised Borat goes away pretty quickly.It was pretty unsettling to actually see the heart of Trump America. Of course I know that these people are out there and have read stuff they say but to actually see it coming out of their mouths made me more afraid of the human race then I already am. It's like watching a racist or cultist talk and you just can't believe that they believe what they're saying.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6230013/?ref_=tt_urv
 We See What We Want To See,3,0,0,wicj,25 October 2020,This is Borat 2. If you didn't get the humor of the first Borat movie you won't get it here either so don't bother watching or reviewing this. Like the first one; this movie had me laughing at the over-the-top portrayal of a backwards man from a backwards country with a lot of stupid sex jokes and shock-material. I also laughed at the all-to-real backwards Americans with the understanding that a lot of what we are seeing is very cleverly edited to make the dupes seem even more ridiculous. If you read interviews of the dupes from the first movie you realize that all is not as it seems. Hours worth of footage is presented as minute-long encounters in which people say really stupid things or appear to agree with Borat on some very risque subjects. So; TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT! I'm sure that we'll hear more stories of how Sasha Baron Cohen and his crew deceived or otherwise bamboozled the people in the movie to act as they did; but we will most likely also conclude that fancy editing aside; some of those people really did say some pretty offensive things. For example; it really doesn't matter how silly a song Borat was singing to the crowd of Texans to make them all look like imbecilic conspiracy theorists; the guy who throws a Nazi salute up is an over-the-top moron.
Like the first movie; this one had too many scenes that seem too contrived and a stretch of the imagination in order to shock or get laughs. Some of it just wasn't all that funny to me; but it had plenty of laughs otherwise. All-in-all; it was entertaining and I watched it for free thanks to Amazon Prime.
But wait -- there's more! I have to take issue with the way that the media; Cohen and the production company have portrayed Rudy Giuliani here. I admit that I was a Rudy fan when I lived in New York and was very impressed with the way he conducted himself on 9/11; but I think he's lost his mind with age and has become nothing short of a hand-puppet for the most (the hugist) imbecilic conspiracy theorist; McDonald Trump. That said; I felt manipulated by the footage of Rudy and had to rewind it several times to try to align what I saw with what I read in the press. CNN and the New York Times would have us believe that he was caught making sexy time (or trying to) with Borat's daughter. What I saw was him stupidly agreeing to finish the interview in the bedroom with an attractive; much younger woman and being a bit touchy-feely (patting her on her hip). What I also saw was a quick shot of him trying to get her hair or microphone or something out of a button or zipper on the top of her dress. It appears that we are missing the lead-up to this; like; perhaps; her asking for him to help her get unstuck) making it even more likely that it was edited to make it look like he was unbuttoning her to get her undressed. The press made a very big deal about him laying on the bed putting his hands down his pants ostensibly to touch his penis. What I saw was her taking his microphone unit from the waist of his pants (you can see it in her hand as she lifts her hands from his pants) and then he lays back to tuck his shirt back in; anyone else who is a bit overweight with a larger belly knows that this is an efficient way to get tucked back in. I understand that the Trump administration is a bunch of ass-clowns just asking to be made fun of; but let's at least show the real stupidity of these people without resorting to the very type of fakery that the conspiracy theorists point to as proof that the holocaust never occurred. And stop feeding the extreme left-wing nut-jobs at CNN and the New York Times.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204164/?ref_=tt_urv
 A few mysteries in the universe...,4,7,24,nakrugt,1 November 2020,There are a few mysteries in the universe that should not even have to be pursued.Yet; here I am pursuing:How can Baron find any jobs and earn lots of money being vain; useless and parasitic?This is not about arts; or politics; or his obvious racism; or him defending freedom of speech while demanding people to be banned on social media platforms.This is about being a representation of utter uselessness since the toilet paper called Ali G.I had watched the first film which was a complete waste of time; and; despite that; I watched this "video file" (I cannot call it a film); which was just a money grab promoted via political corruption that it pretends to criticize.Nonetheless; watch and see it yourself.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6223518/?ref_=tt_urv
 Disappointing,2,7,24,neetabora,28 October 2020,Started with too much excitement but found it disappointing.
Except the daughter's rule book concept; nothing else was funny. The climax was fine but it felt too stretched.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6212195/?ref_=tt_urv
 A rushed big disappointment,2,9,34,tdofeldt,27 October 2020,I am a big fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's previous work as borat and Ali G. It was daring and hilarious because he exposed people in a clever way by pretending to be much dumber than he is.
However; borat 2 was not a "great success" according to me.As soon I saw the trailer; I was both excited but concerned about the casting of his female co star. She did not change my mind since she was came across as annoying and ruined most of the scenes she was in. Also; it seemed she aimed for the ideology; that weird faces and loud noises equals funny. Instead she made it cringe worhty and at times i even had to skip her bits talking in the movie.Sacha Baron Cohen did a better performance; although at many times; he seemed off character such as the rally gig. There were also other times like the mike pence scene where he acts completely different. Therefore; the idea of disguising a disguised person did not work out in this case. I laughed perhaps at 3 occasions throughout the movie which was only Sacha's single scenes.The scripted parts in the movie were terrible and Sacha should have focused on funny pranks instead of monotonous dialogues with Borat's daughter. At times; I felt like I was watching a movie aimed for kids. For example; the ending made was cringe worthy and the combination of vulgarity and childish script gave was terrible.Also; the one sided political aspect of this movie was disappointing. This movie will be irrelevant in five years since its main purpose seemed to focus on the election.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6210899/?ref_=tt_urv
 Condescending and 100% political,5,6,20,johngalt-40834,24 October 2020,Plot: a Californian with net worth $160m taking pleasure in humiliating peopleThis movie is mostly propaganda focusing on current events and will be forgotten five minutes after the election.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202594/?ref_=tt_urv
 Trump 2020! watch them cry!!! haha this just exposed how the left think!,5,6,20,Jigsjigz,24 October 2020,Was amazing seeing the world through the eyes of a woke far left liberal loony; they tried so hard to paint the people who love america as bad but just ended up making them look as mentally unstable as borat! LOL,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200659/?ref_=tt_urv
 VERY DISSAPOINTING - and I'm a fan of Sacha,5,8,30,BenCurtisActor,30 October 2020,The movie was terrible. He clearly doesn't have the clout in America anymore; the scenes were chopped up very poorly and the narrative storyline they tried didn't work at all. He really didn't get anyone to say anything provocative or interesting. Clearly many of the scenes are manipulated and forced. Probably his worst film to date. He didn't make any statements about America that are new or reveal anything we don't already know. His interviews sucked and the film was mostly Borat and his "daughter" and some guy at a copy machine store. Sacha you have fallen. At least you asked people to get out and vote!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6217746/?ref_=tt_urv
 Worth a look if you're bored....,1,8,30,Crankgorilla,27 October 2020,I thought it was funny enough. That scene where he and his daughter were dancing for "higher society".... omg my jaw hit the floor and I was peeking out behind hands that covered my eye's.... The ending was an obvious lay down of cards in where Cohen stands politically though. That was a let down. A good 4/10 from me. Not essential viewing; but worth a look in if you're bored.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6210476/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not funny anymore,4,8,30,mckennaian,24 October 2020,Too much Kazakh and reading subtitles. Super political. He should have stopped at Bruno.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201970/?ref_=tt_urv
 Rubbish!,2,5,16,cami_92,24 October 2020,I don't know what the point of this movie was; I missed the good ol Borat who wasn't afraid to bash anybody; this seemed like a desperate attempt to 'play it safe' but actually; I think this was the end of Borat. I personally prefer the first one; instead of this crap.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201339/?ref_=tt_urv
 A movie for the times, take that as you will,3,5,16,ryanpersaud-59415,24 October 2020,So; the positive. I think this movie does; at least begin; with some of the nostalgic cringe humour of the original. The movie is at its best when "ordinary people" are in a ridiculous and offensive situation. I also thought the girl playing Borat's daughter was FANTASTIC. She kept up with and sometimes even exceeded Cohen. I frequently found myself laughing at the scenes with her.The bad...the partisanship. The original Borat had a bit of humanism to it. People revealed their prejudices and biases when put in this weird situation. He sort of acted as an equal opportunity offender. In this one; it's far more partisan. Almost like ; "wow; look at this stupid portion of the population!"The parts where Borat just wanted us to shake our heads and say; "wow; look at these people;" were the least funny to me. Also; I found the film considerably slowed down when it got to the staged stuff.Overall; a nice but if nostalgia; but nowhere near as good as the original.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200871/?ref_=tt_urv
 Mostly cringe.,2,5,16,mystuffhere,24 October 2020,There were some funny moments but the movie as a whole wasn't nearly as funny as the first. The basic story takes what would've been a few jokes about the mistreatment of women in Borat's country previously and makes it a running gag that goes ridiculously far with it. Relies too much on gross out humor. Hard to watch at times. It wasn't even that successful in political figure-damning. At least not how I expected it to be. Not really quotable or re-watchable.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200864/?ref_=tt_urv
 Was this a necessity to make?...,10,5,16,paul_haakonsen,23 October 2020,While "Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" is a watchable and at times funny movie; it was not really as entertaining as the 2006 "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" movie.Granted; I am not much of a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen; but I was given the chance to sit down and watch the 2020 sequel movie; so of course I did so.I will say that there were a handful of scenes in the movie that were good for a laugh; and even also a couple of cringeworthy scenes; but the overall of the movie just doesn't stack up to compare to the first movie; which was way more funny and cringeworthy.This 2020 movie is definitely a movie that will be a win with fan of Sacha Baron Cohen; no doubt about that. But for the average movie viewer; I think the comedy and the movie as a whole will fall short.Personally I didn't really see the need for a sequel to the 2006 movie. But since we were given one; it was a shame that it wasn't much more of a stronger movie experience. I mean; it just felt sort of half-hearted most of the time; as if Sacha Baron Cohen was playing it safe and just running on auto-pilot.While the movie was watchable; it was not a movie that impressed me much. My rating of this 2020 sequel lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199837/?ref_=tt_urv
 Ugh.,5,9,35,mgalante-11439,30 October 2020,This actor or whatever he is is totally repulsive.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6219395/?ref_=tt_urv
 Baiting Low-Hanging Fruit,5,9,35,swordsnare,29 October 2020,It's ubiquitous that most people are aware of Sacha Baron Cohen and his satire these days.It's been 14 years since the original one and 11 years since Bruno. This satire gets tiresome and cringe once people are aware of the joke and realise in the edit that most of it is not real. It doesn't seem as edgy as the original either. I wanted to like it; but it just wasn't for me. Only an opinion for what it's worth.I give 4/10 for his previous better work like Ali G..,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6215384/?ref_=tt_urv
 That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore,4,9,35,mujali-48677,27 October 2020,Humour is subjective. However it's arguable that depravity; offence-causing and general crassness requires very little comedic skill. Nothing new was bought to the table here except very obvious political leanings and a quest to belittle those whose views differ. I say this as someone who has very little interest in politics in general; so I don't have a viewpoint or dogma to defend. I just think there should be balance in everything; especially if art is a vehicle through which society can heal. That's why Bill Burr is such a legend as he mocks everyone!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6211917/?ref_=tt_urv
 Vulgarity Taken To A New Level,10,10,41,Comphunk,26 October 2020,No this was anything but Borat. It starts off at a vulgar tone and ends with the same. I had to skip many parts due to this. It was painful to watch. This was a political satire done in worst possible way. If you were looking for comedy; forget about it; all you are going to get is watching pubic hairs and butt *oles. There's hardly anything of note. A movie done in haste. In fact seems no real effort was put in.
Disappointed,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6209407/?ref_=tt_urv

If you are a Trump lover you probably should just skip it along with 99% of all movies due to the fact nobody relevant in Hollywood supports him. Also it's hard not to compare to the first one but try to.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199158/?ref_=tt_urv
 Could've Been So Much Funnier!,7,6,21,sukumar-83997,23 October 2020,As most sequels; this one is lacking that touch of originality. The actress playing his daughter Tutar is good. Borat is not always convincing but there are several funny and many cringeworthy scenes. Unfortunately; the scenes with Pence and Giuliani did not work and not funny. Overall; a mediocre export from Kazakhstan.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198181/?ref_=tt_urv
 Some hilarious some awful,7,4,12,dustyvanbrocklin,27 October 2020,As my review title says it is kind of feast or famine with Borat 2. Some of the pranks were great; but some were just plain not funny. Without giving spoilers it's hard to describe. The only thing I will say is the o e that was leaked about Rudy was creepy; but clearly he was tucking his shirt after taking off the mic. If anyone say anything different you are a dope. The first movie was revolutionary the second one was not.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6209826/?ref_=tt_urv

 Better than the first! Wawawewa,1,4,12,ieddaddy,25 October 2020,Whoever says this one isn't better than the first clearly got lost. It's just masterful how Sacha was able to pull this off being that everyone knows him; there was a pandemic and shutdown. And the cherry on all of this was Rudy Giuliani who didn't know about his involvement to the film until the very week it was released. Also he made himself look extremely creepier than usual. The female actress was a true rock star. Yes this was better than the first one. 10/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206106/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not as good an once was,10,4,12,drr-31528,24 October 2020,Great to see the character return but this film was poorly executed and only had a couple of funny moments.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201311/?ref_=tt_urv
 My cheeks are hurting,10,4,12,farshadtami,23 October 2020,I laughed for an hour and a half and now my cheeks hurt. A similar taste to Cohen's previous movies; but perhaps with a more sober tone towards the end. And more so as the credits ended.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199486/?ref_=tt_urv
 Just like its predecessor, this is a funny and smart satire of American society,3,3,8,andrewroy-04316,26 October 2020,Borat Subsequent Moviefilm definitely has the same feel as the original; though it is certainly less of a broad exploration of American culture than a very pointed political satire aimed at the current election. It may be less timeless than the first due to its emphasis on Trump and the current political climate; but I also think the clarity works well for its purpose. We get the same style of jokes here - Borat meeting various types of people and seeing many of the flaws and prejudices held by Americans. Much of the film is spent with two Trump supporters and later parts of the film center on Giuliani; and the ending really drives home the message that even people from the backwards nation of Kazakhstan recognize the idiocy of the current administration and many of its racist supporters. I also thought the COVID-based twist in the film was funny and worked very well. The biggest star of the show; though; is actually Borat's daughter; played by Bakalova. She is absolutely fantastic; which I imagine is even harder to do when some of the characters weren't acting. There are a lot more jokes here centered on Kazakh backwardness; particularly regarding women (for example; I didn't find the jokes about the book to be that great); which are the ones I liked least about the first and feel the same here. Most of its scenes focused on satirizing modern America; however; are fantastic. The Trump supporters; the Giuliani and Pence scenes; and the ending all work really well. Also; while it wasn't really a political joke; the scene talking about getting the baby out of her was the funniest bit from either of the movies. Just like the first; it has its hits and its misses; but at the end of the day it's a comedy with lots of funny moments and plenty of interesting ideas and scenes.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207300/?ref_=tt_urv
 A winner! Borat harrasses the far right in America.,1,3,8,TxMike,25 October 2020,This is a very irreverent movie on many levels; people who enjoy irreverent movies will generally love this one because of the inventiveness. Unless you are a Trump fan.There is a made-up reason for Borat's mission to the USA; to deliver his 15-yr-old daughter as a bride; in the end he realizes he was sent there to spread the virus that caused COVID-19. He and his daughter (actress actually about 23 during production) run a series of scams; perhaps the most interesting with Rudy Giuliani in a hotel room because it currently (Oct 2020) is making the rounds in various news outlets. He was taken in totally by the scam of being interviewed by a cute; inexperienced foreign reporter; touching her affectionately; afterwards going to the bedroom for a drink; then appearing to pleasure himself with his hand down his pants. But probably just tucking his shirt in; as he claims. It is very funny if you are not on the receiving end of the joke.Anyway overall I found it to be a well made and very funny movie; mostly making fun of Trump and his supporters. If I were a Trump fan I'd likely react very differently. I watched it on Amazon streaming via my Roku.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205291/?ref_=tt_urv

 #notmyborat,1,4,13,davidaustinshane,24 October 2020,The charm of the first movie was that you could never tell when people were in on the joke or genuine candid people. This movie had maybe one good moment like that; but never really hit the sweet spot. None of the jokes really hit like the first one. It felt lazy and forced. yay it's fun to make fun of republicans I guess; but you have to at least make it funny. The movie literally ends this "Go vote" if that tells you the reason this movie was made and released when it was. Spoiler alert: it wasn't for fans who've been excited for another Borat movie for years.

Not for the faint hearted; it will almost certainly offend the intellectually challenged Gun Totin' Conservative Americans; Evangelicals; etc...........This is; in essence; a sharp parody of all thats been bad in America for the past few years.I found it hilarious.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199793/?ref_=tt_urv

 I felt disgusted - way too sick!,8,9,39,yalikitty,31 October 2020,This is a disgusting movie with blasphemy. The movie started a bit funny and it touches politics way too much. Its It's actually all about politics. They played around with a very sensitive topic which is abortion in a very unsensitive; disgusting way. This film is a punch in the stomach for all women. Is just disgusting. My husband and I we decided to stop watching the movie in the scene where the girl is dancing and her dress is all cover in blood due to her menstruation. An absolute disgusting scene that seriously should be prohibited.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6220545/?ref_=tt_urv
 Eh,2,5,18,pcampionz,29 October 2020,Some funny scenes but all in all just an eh. This guy needs to just go away already. But when you are in the "club"; you are in the club and once in the club one can continue to suck for a while and still make movies.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6216004/?ref_=tt_urv
 Had me howling,10,5,18,Timburrr,23 October 2020,Sacha you have done it again!! The icing on the cake for me was Guiliani's October surprise,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198940/?ref_=tt_urv
 I was looking forward to this,10,9,40,alirakla,29 October 2020,More than half the skits were fake.; Borat is the only funny guy in the whole movie and he is not as good as he was in the first one because everyone knows him in the US.; I love the first one but this one has no rewatch value and it's just disgusting.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6216806/?ref_=tt_urv
 Foreign arbage,6,3,9,caleb-jamiesons,7 November 2020,Unntural foreign garbage.You think it's funny that we live for our country; guns ans country? Then the joke's on you. A relation between a father and a daughter is their affair and protected by the constitution. So there.
Hail President Trump.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6243965/?ref_=tt_urv
 Very tame compared to first movie.,8,3,9,OzMovieWatcher,26 October 2020,I watched it free to air on Solar Movies website (where you can watch tens of thousands of movies for free).. Compared to the first movie; this one was very tame. I do not regret watching it; I found it entertaining; but I found it slow and really lacking in humor.In reality; no way could Sacha Baron Cohen repeat the earlier classic and certainly not expect it to be better;. The shock factor is long gone.I really considered this one as mediocre.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208236/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not bad but first one was better,1,3,9,amatorium,26 October 2020,The second part has some funny moments but cannot reach the level of the first one. Maybe because people already have high expectations and also due to some repetitions. Overall; it is a fun movie to watch (not many funny movies coming lately from Hollywood).but it somewhat more predictable.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6208218/?ref_=tt_urv
 A worthy, if somewhat forgettable, follow up,10,3,9,jtindahouse,26 October 2020,When I heard there was a surprise new 'Borat' film coming out I really didn't know whether to dread it or be excited for it. I absolutely love the original 'Borat' film from 2006. It would be very close to one of my favourite comedy films of all time. I hate it when a sequel to a film I love comes along and tarnishes its reputation. I'm pleased to say that even though 'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm' doesn't come close to recreating the magic the original found; it is still more than competent enough to do no damage whatsoever to the original.I was surprised how little difference there was in the 'Borat' character considering the 14 year gap between films. I remember when 'Dumb and Dumberer' came out I couldn't get over how different the characters looked and acted to their younger versions. That isn't the case here though. Sacha Baron Cohen clearly takes very good care of himself and I suspect he has also continued to practise the character over the years.I actually really liked the story they picked for this sequel. It worked really well and was always guiding the film without ever taking it over. There's also a nice little twist to look out for. The only thing letting the film down is basically memorable moments. The original had so many of them; whereas 'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm' feels more like a film that is fun to watch once; but will then be quickly forgotten. Still though; I'm just happy it wasn't a complete mess. This one's a lot of fun and worth a watch.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207880/?ref_=tt_urv
 Dishonest, mean and yet boring movie,10,3,9,vegard1989,26 October 2020,I think no one should stoop to such a low level of making a movie like this. It's a scripted and professionally filmed movie that supports a few scenes designed to shock you and 'uncover' something about others.
In reality; what happens is that Borat exploits other people's friendliness; openness and patience while insulting them with pubertal humor; having a camera crew in the bushes hoping for an improper reaction.
He does tricks from his older content; such as showing up and identifying with a group of people;appearing foreign and well-meaning; but then twisting the content more and more towards very inappropriate. It was funny back then; but this time around almost no one got fooled or reacted to any of his jokes; even though he tried harder and harder to shock. And when making something like a self proclaimed political commentary; with interviews of real people in a false context; I don't think this is an okay way of doing it. The 'shocking' scene at the end was a beautiful woman talking about how starstruck she was; flirting with that Rudy guy; then pulling him into a bedroom. Then Borat comes in yelling that she was 15; when in fact she was 24; playing a serious adult role of reporter; nothing like the more childish daughter role of earlier in the movie. Like some episode of how to catch a predator. There wasn't anything revealed there even. I don't know; I think it's tasteless and whatever story they are trying to serve it's viewers I think most would find it counter-productive to that.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207660/?ref_=tt_urv
 Genius!,7,3,9,peerman,25 October 2020,The first half is funny but gross-out cringey (and socially and politically no-holds barred). The second half is genius.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206301/?ref_=tt_urv
 An important watch,10,3,9,meghanzwiers,25 October 2020,Sacha Baron Cohen has hilarious blown open the undeniable corruption of America's currently politics and called out all those who are complicit with it. Never has anything so educational made me laugh so much.Please watch this - it's message is so important. Not only are bad men undeniably exposed for who they really are; but a glimpse is given into the hope and the good that America could be.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205185/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hit and miss, but a new star is born.,9,3,9,coldwarkid,23 October 2020,Not as funny or charming as the first movie; but still better than anything else around at the moment. This time the target(s) of his humour are almost entirely Republicans and the right; which became a bit tiresome; though I'd love to know the full SP on the Giuliani scene. What really kept this film afloat was Borat's daughter (Maria Bakalova ); she really owned the role and ran away with it; I don't think I've been so impressed with a new actor in many years; she was fantastic I hope we see more from her soon.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199730/?ref_=tt_urv
 Leisure Feature Review,4,3,9,leisurefeature,23 October 2020,Sasha Baron Cohen dusts off the grey suit for a second run as Borat Sagdiyev; fourteen years after the release of the first Borat film. If you saw the 2006 film you know what to expect; satire and social commentary turned up to 11. Cohen still employs his heavy-handed approach to making very nuanced comments on modern society; all wrapped in cringe-inducing humor. Seeing people agree with and feel emboldened by his use of stereotypes that create a safe space for bigotry and misogyny show the audience how prevalent hate still is in the world. Cohen again holds a mirror up to society and creates laughs for those already in on the truth.81/100,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199185/?ref_=tt_urv
 A complete disaster,3,6,24,mia_ams,3 November 2020,1st borat movie was very good and funny.
2nd borat movie a complete disaster to the point where my son 17 years old did not finish it.
No where near as funny as the first borat
What a waist of money and energy really...,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6231825/?ref_=tt_urv
 Great comedy! He's back,4,6,24,swishitsenthil,23 October 2020,Borat again delivers comedy in very awkward situations as he exposes America in the most humorous way possible. A lot of shocking moments. Definitely worth the watch. It is not as good as the first one but definitely just as shocking.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198948/?ref_=tt_urv
 Still hope,9,2,5,whittsco-98634,7 November 2020,Excellent. Breath of fresh air from PC nonsense that is typically made today. Extra stars just for having the courage to make this film in the current political climate,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6244574/?ref_=tt_urv
 OMG Borat,3,2,5,mohammad_poursabah,26 October 2020,Honestly; I was so waiting to see this movie; but I must say that it was very weak compared to the previous version!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206848/?ref_=tt_urv
 Wow. Some people don't understand what satire is.,1,2,5,IvankaDumpsalot,23 October 2020,Kind of disappointing to read conservatives' ratings just calling the film juvenile and not funny. Did they just not get it? This is satire; and since there appears to be confusion somehow: Cohen does not hate Jews or women; or even the Q Anon guys he lived with for 5 days. He said they were simply good; normal people who had just been fed a diet of lies. He's a good man and a funny one at that. Why are you so upset that bigotry and hate is being called out for what it is in this film?Just look no further than the current president if you want to criticize someone for being so morally bankrupt; a man who thinks he can grab women's crotches whenever he wants. It's a shame that any man would defend this twisted power trip.Giuliani is a creep; and it's on tape. Like the president; he loves women laughably younger than him; and cheating on their spouses is just second nature to them (hm... seems pretty common with politicians in general; though. Hi; Bill; hello Mr. Weiner).But I really can't understand defending this embarrassing president and trashing any movie that makes you feel like your supposed political sensibilities are offended. You know who's not offended by this film? People who don't identify as Nazis; and also people who understand what. satire. is. Borat is a character and does not reflect the actual views of Cohen... he is a vessel to expose anti-Semitism; racism; sexism; and so many things that hurt human beings.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197824/?ref_=tt_urv
 Double Trouble!,10,4,14,annlevtex,23 October 2020,I actually liked this one better than the first Borat. Granted; you can't have Borat 2 without the original; because you need the set-up. But adding his daughter to the mix produces some hilarious; bonkers; on-point and even oddly poignant results. The young actress who plays her has SBC's fearlessness; comic instincts and gift for improv. She's terrific. How she got through the debutante ball dance scene is beyond me. They just make a great pair and have wonderful chemistry as actors and partners in crime.It's more overtly topical than the first one; which I for one like. I'm a news and political junky so I like being able to laugh my head off over issues that usually give me a headache and angst.....sexism; authoritarianism; Qanon; etc. There is outrageous humor and gross-out moments and glorious punking; but there is also something of a storyline and even a character arc; which makes the movie more satisfying.The bit players who are unwittingly roped into the story all add to the fun and lessons learned; especially the babysitter he hires for his daughter; an unflappable shipping store employee and two women he meets at a synagogue while wearing an insane "Jewish Disguise" apparently based on Medieval caricatures. One of the women; a Holocaust survivor; died not long ago and he dedicates the movie to her.Borat 2 might not be as iconic as its predecessor or make as much money; but it's still SBC in top form and I'm grateful for it. I could watch it again tonight and laugh twice as hard.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198904/?ref_=tt_urv
 Very poor taste,1,6,25,bef1991,31 October 2020,To be honest; I'm not a fan of Cohen's brand of comedy. That said; his past films exposed people in power for greed and racism. This time he pranked really good people; the kind babysitter; the Christian Counselor and the Jewish ladies. I thought that was in very poor taste.Frankly this film made me cringe so many times it was hard to watch. I know he's going for shock value but it repulsed me.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6221530/?ref_=tt_urv
 Meh,1,6,25,kenyuhoshina,31 October 2020,Some funny scenes but not even close to as good as the original. Like a 16 year old wrote it. Lots of repetitive and corny jokes.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6220549/?ref_=tt_urv
 better then first one. still garbage,10,7,31,mrpicky,28 October 2020,Much better then the first one. this one actually had some writers and a point to it. but still cringe and border idiotic. pathetic idea ; pathetic characters; cringe supreme.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213906/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat just saved 2020,10,5,20,bshafrir,23 October 2020,I am a huge fan of the original Borat. I've seen it about 60 times. I had high hopes for this and it paid off. With 2020 being the worst year EVER; we needed a good movie to cheer everyone up. Borat did that and made us all get a good laugh. Not as good of the first; but no one was expecting it to be as good. To sum it up for everyone; WATCH THIS MOVIE. Watch it especially if you loved the first. 8.5/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198760/?ref_=tt_urv
 Boring, not borat,10,8,38,frejou86,27 October 2020,Borat 1 is classic; its well made with a story and most importantly it made me lauge. This one failed in every category. I would not recommend it to anyone.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6210271/?ref_=tt_urv

 Thanks!!,10,4,15,Amit9FW,23 October 2020,After watching the 1st Part "Borat" over a decade ago; I always wanted a 2nd part and after 14 long years finally it is here. An amazing movie and not to be taken in a wrong way. It is just for fun.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198994/?ref_=tt_urv

 Big Cohen fan, but this movie was a disappointment,10,3,10,l_moen94,24 October 2020,I was hyped once I learned another Borat was coming out. I had seen the right rally concert leaked and thought it was hilarious; couldn't wait to see the whole deal.The trailer also looked hilarious. Sadly the trailer basicly spoiled the whole movie as it had all the best jokes in it; the trailer even had stuff the movie didn't. The right rally gig wasa big disappointment as the movie was more focused on the scripted plot than showing borat trolling Trump supporters. The leaked video filmed with a phone was miles better as it only shows borat singing.Do NOT watch the trailer and you might find the movie a lot funnier.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201083/?ref_=tt_urv
 Kinda disappointing,10,3,10,jackmacfhionnaile,23 October 2020,It was a good watch for the most part although it was just not near as funny as the original borat; the performance from sacha baron cohen wasn't a good one in comparison to the original borat.You should watch it though its still decent but really not as good as the OG borat,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199985/?ref_=tt_urv
 Time capsule of 2020 America, filled with jawdropping segments and seamless political commentary insertions, capped with an incredible ending,10,3,10,BlizzyFoxTF,23 October 2020,Who knew there is still so much gas left in Sacha Baron Cohen's tank 14 years into the future? And as Borat; no less.I have been a big fan of SBC's work for many years. Borat is a one of a kind classic. Ali G and Bruno are also testaments to not only his comedic genius; but his keen eye on social satire. I am not the biggest fan of "Who is America?". I think the series is inconsistent and relies too much on crude humor. No one expected SBC to pull his beloved old character from the dead in what I consider to be his most adventurous project yet; and yet he did.While some of those vulgar sex jokes from "Who is America?" still carry over to this film; it is its most salient flaw. This "sequel" brought the retired character of Borat into the limelight and improved upon its predecessor not only in narrative flow; but also its characters and plot. The quality of the prank gets better as the film plays out; and what the film delivered in emotional beats; political commentary and entertainment value as it resolves is beyond my expectations. It feels like both an update on the American social and political climate; and a love letter/beautiful resolution to the themes and ideas presented in the first Borat film. It justifies its existence in triumphant style. Given the circumstances surrounding the production; with the COVID-19 virus still prevalent as of the film's release; this film is a rare gem that almost feels impossible to concoct given its sheer ambition and big risks. Not sure if I can credit it to a perfect storm of coincidences or just SBC's experience and genius.This film is an essential watch. I can understand how it may be unsuitable for certain audiences; especially parties that the film blatantly targets against and audiences who are turned away by Baron's typical hard R content. However; for those who "gets it" and appreciate what SBC has contributed to humanity over the last two decades; this is an fresh classic; almost a throwback to the old days of the Ali G show and Borat. For this I and many others are elated. Ladies and folks; we got another Borat/Bruno to savour!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199651/?ref_=tt_urv
 Complete and Utter Trash,3,5,21,mdrifke,2 November 2020,I think I actually lost brain cells watching the first 20 minutes of this movie. One would have to have an EXTREMELY warped and demented sense of humor to enjoy this film.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6231480/?ref_=tt_urv
 An Excellent Sequel,10,5,21,aidanratesmovies,23 October 2020,Incredibly enjoyable; hilarious; and very entertaining- the sequel to 2006's legendary comedy Borat somehow is able to not only hold up in this time and age; but also prove to be almost just as good as its predecessor. Being a huge fan of Sacha Baron Cohen; I enjoyed this film quite a lot. It was what I wanted it to be; not necessarily more; but it was satisfying to watch nevertheless. The film is a brilliant and well executed satire on values; our government today; and of course politics- and between these themes; ideas; and messages; it is also able to provide a surprisingly compelling story. I of course enjoyed Cohen's return as the outrageous titular character; as well as the continuation and expansion on many of the insane concepts from the first film. The biggest surprise of the film; however; is Maria Bakalova performance as Borat's daughter Tutar. She is not only able to keep up with Borat's outrageous situations; but also prove to be quite funny; moving; and fun to watch on screen. It's an insane film; with insane shoes to fill; but somehow this sequel from legendary comedian Sacha Baron Cohen is able to accomplish all of it; while proving to be more consistent and almost as funny as the original.
My Rating: 9.75/10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198897/?ref_=tt_urv

 Clever writers,2,4,16,ojadran4,23 October 2020,This movie has so much comedy and heartwarming moments that it makes you forget to realise how amazing the films writers are that they were able to adapt so well to the current pandemic situation to give this movie even more of that tasty realism and make this a true Borat movie,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199484/?ref_=tt_urv

 Pretty funny. 7/10,7,4,16,sasho_mladenovic,23 October 2020,Yes I rated it a 10 to help offset the morons voting it a 1/10. But it's truly a 7 for me. Classic Borat punch lines with some definite cringe moments;as expected. Nice little twist at the end. It was not as political as some reviews state. Yes there's politics it's pokes fun at both the left and right but it's about the humour. Have to check it out if you're a Borat fan!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199248/?ref_=tt_urv

 Less of a comedy, more of an examination,6,8,42,harrylosborne,29 October 2020,I didn't really think I was going to enjoy this Borat revival; but I was quietly optimistic; given the generally positive reviews circulating online. I have in hindsight realised that they were speaking well of this film not for the humour (which is crass and lazy for the most part); but for its political commentary on the current state of the USA. Despite this; Borat is still far from a good film; leaning on some terrible comedy and its reputation for commercial success.In a similar vein to its predecessor; Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is a film that mocks itself; belittling genders; races and personal beliefs over the meagre 1.5 hour runtime. I know this is the point; but it doesn't make watching any easier: particular jokes (one aimed at the Jewish community and another based around female puberty) were actually painful to witness; getting more of an embarrassed response than anything else. Behind these set pieces were some legitimately clever moments and even some properly written gags; but it wouldn't be worth sitting through the dreg to get to them.In spite of this; the clever aspect of Borat is in his unassuming nature. By being naive and clueless (and at times extremist in his views); he lulls Americans into a false sense of security; which allows some insightful moments. My personal favourites included managing to extricate a Nazi salute from a Republican voter; whilst another showed the brutally honest misogyny of a southern man at a Debutante Ball. There is technically a "story" to this film as well; but it's a stretch to call it worth paying attention to. Something that really irked me was the excessive green-screening used: clearly the budget did not extend to sending the cast and crew all over the globe; but not even having the energy to build a low-budget set on-site just looks careless to me.All in all; Borat was not good. It wasn't very clever; it wasn't very funny; but more than anything; it didn't tell me anything about the crazy parts of the USA I didn't already know. In reality; you'd be better off watching the Youtube channel "All Gas No Brakes" - political humour; whilst leaving the crass jokes at the door.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6216890/?ref_=tt_urv

 I am very shocked that Sacha made this movie....,1,3,11,Growfeather,23 October 2020,After working in the industry for so long Borat has become a very well known face. First Borat was released when social media and youtube wasnt really a thing. People didnt have smartphones. Today its much more difficult to make this movie without getting recorded by fanboys or strangers. I wasn't really expecting it to be as great as first one but given current time it delivered everything that first movie had.It could be less scripted but to be honest that would be quite impossible in a time when everyone has a smartphone. I am surprised he was able to perform this well.I am not going to release any details but definitely worth watching.Watch it now!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199558/?ref_=tt_urv
 Don't compare it with its prequel,2,2,6,siddhujampa,26 October 2020,Sacha Baron Cohen and the other girl who acted as his daughter have done a wonderful job. But Larry Charles could have done much better just like he entertained us with crude humor and offensive comedy as in the prequel of this film.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207719/?ref_=tt_urv
 What a Basket of Deplorables!,2,2,6,tccandler,26 October 2020,Sacha Baron Cohen revisits his most famous character in what feels like another in a long line of tired retread comedies. What was groundbreaking 15 years ago is now a tad uninspired. Sure; there are a handful of good chuckles... However; the main takeaway from this film is that the red half of America is one of the least educated (verging on mentally challenged) basket of deplorables in the world. But again... Everyone already knew that.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207127/?ref_=tt_urv
 Same same same,5,2,6,louis-zaltzman,25 October 2020,Same same same ... Shows the structural problems in the US; but a bit boring. Has a good ending.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206214/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat returns... But at what cost?,10,2,6,matthewhoggett,23 October 2020,Borat's anticipated return was epic when I first learned of it! But I always knew it would never be as good as the original. I hoped it would at least be good; but I prepared for the worst. It had its moments; but overall was a let-down. There was way too much focus on Borat's daughter. I didn't watch this for her! I want to watch a Borat movie for the man himself! Would I recommend you watch this? Yes. But only if you have an hour and a half to spare and you don't fancy watching anything else. Aside from that; don't rush to see this,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199602/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not bad,10,2,6,PennyForMyThoughts,23 October 2020,The film was not as side-splittingly hilarious as the first one; but perhaps that's just because the ridiculousness of "everyday Americans" has already been so exposed in all forms of media that it is no longer shocking.Still a sharp satire with some funny moments; worth a watch.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199237/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat is back,8,2,6,ignatdanilchuk,23 October 2020,Sasha Baron Cohen returned to his beloved role of Borat Sagdiyev; once the already recognizable Kazakh journalist finds himself in the realities of the USA in 2020. Pandemic; rallies and the election race; all of this is somehow involved in the plot. This time Borat is not acting alone; his daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) helps him in this. Tutar Sagdieva is a fifteen-year-old girl who is an exact copy of her father; she knows neither morality nor mores. She perfectly complements Borat as a character and develops him.In comparison with the first film; the jokes did not become sharper; and the toilet humor did not diminish; but fourteen years have passed since the release of the first film about Borat. During this time; the world has changed; and we have changed after it. The film makes fun of feminism; anti-Semitism and the foundations of society. Considering today's tolerant society; Borat 2 looks very brave.
It's amazing to see how Baron Cohen comes closer and closer to the destruction of the fourth wall throughout the film and indicates his intentions in the material itself.Fourteen years after the release of the first Borat film; it was difficult to choose a better time for such a burning and important message. The film gives us new reasons to fear the world; but it also gives us the opportunity to laugh at them.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199203/?ref_=tt_urv
 It's ok,4,2,6,alezandradavila,23 October 2020,Not as funny as original I think they waited to long fir a 2nd movie there was some laughs the whole movie no,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198915/?ref_=tt_urv

 Propaganda disguised as a comedy,10,5,23,mlivziey,1 November 2020,This film has a few moments of comedy. Otherwise; it is pure Hollywood propaganda. I went into the film having seen the first; but knowing very little about the sequel. I should have used context clues to decipher the sole purpose of the film.... to influence voting. The film ends with the text "now vote; or be executed". This was strategically released a little over a week before the election in an attempt to sway public opinion. It failed. Even as a comedy; this film was full of old tropes and overplayed stereotypes. Watch at your own risk; but be prepared to be let down.Cohen succeeds at very little in this film. It is a reminder that he is a one trick pony and is more of an activist than an actor. Any acclaim for this film will be on purely political grounds. Hard pass.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6223560/?ref_=tt_urv
 Tired retread of the original,10,5,23,stevenmortonuk,31 October 2020,The original was a classic but this is a poor sequel. The jokes aren't as funny; the characters aren't as strong; the whole thing comes across as desperate.
In a couple of years people will admit that this movie sucks.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6221318/?ref_=tt_urv
 They tried, and it will make you laugh but it's too contrived,6,4,17,bluenoseneil,28 October 2020,The very satirical and current nature of Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm is what makes it good. Republicans will be literally swearing at the TV.HOWEVER; this is counterbalanced with some overly contrived scenes; a little to heavy reliance on shock comedy moments and a bit of a pacing issue l; which is never a great sign for a film with such a short running time.I love Sacha Baren Cohen and most of his work; but this one felt like a step too far in the wrong direction to be anything more than a semi-watchable footnote in his Filmography in 3-5 years from now.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213975/?ref_=tt_urv
 Brilliant satire.,6,4,17,vanessalit,23 October 2020,God did I need to laugh and I did. Especially loved the storyline spoofing patriarchal culture and Melania's golden cage. The debutante ball punk couldn't have been any funnier. And then there was the crashing of some kind of republican ladies' affair. Kudos to Borak's costar who was superb!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199403/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious and brillant of you like dark humor,10,4,17,pablofisch,23 October 2020,Hilarious and brillant of you like dark Humor. A very good sequal to the Match changing first Borat Film of 2006.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198965/?ref_=tt_urv
 Sacha has still got it.,6,4,17,joehenley-26606,23 October 2020,Not quite as many shocking moments and more focus on the story compared to the first but the climate that Sacha has to do this in was insane with the virus going on. It's hard not to look at the original with nostalgia but still pretty damn good.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198814/?ref_=tt_urv

I highly recommend. I will keep my monthly subscription to amazon just for this one ; looove it .,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6223484/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious movie!,1,1,2,metfreak93005,29 October 2020,This movie was awesome. Huge that the super serious Trumpers have such a hard time finding the humor in it all.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6217303/?ref_=tt_urv
 Topical and mildly entertaining,3,1,2,tylerkom,26 October 2020,The film is a very quick watch that really does not take itself seriously at all. Some bits are downright hilarious but others are only mildly entertaining. The plot which holds together all the bits is not very strong; not that anyone expected it to be. It's a decent film that may have been better in a YouTube format.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207657/?ref_=tt_urv
 Couple really funny scenes,10,1,2,scottbedoe,25 October 2020,There's a few really funny scenes; otherwise it was pretty boring.

 It's racist, sexist, offensive, and a bad movie, but none of that matters, because it's Borat,3,1,2,sauravbmb,25 October 2020,Yet again Sacha Baron Cohen presents to us an outstanding work of filmmaking. It is difficult to imagine a better; more hilarious; and yet terrifying take at today's United States. Until you reach the end; you cannot take your eyes off the screen; and as it comes to an end; you are left with one question; "What the hell was that!!!" Well; that was racist; that was sexist; offensive; that was bad; but none of that matters; because that was Borat! If you want to watch this subsequent moviefilm; first throw all your expectations and all your understanding about filmmaking out of the window. Only then you can grasp how in all its vulgarity; in all its pointlessness it exposes the terrifying reality. And yes; it is a terrifying reality indeed. The sequel is way more scripted then the original movie; which was surprising; but perhaps necessary. As Borat himself puts; "People make recognize my face". That scene with Rudy Giuliani -- I would not spoil anything but would just say that the world needs more filmmakers like Cohen and fewer politicians like Giuliani. Mara Bakalova is another awesome gift of this movie; hope to see her appearing in more challenging roles in the future. In summary; Cohen; you have delivered a masterpiece that does not fall short of the original movie a bit; but rather stands as an excellent sequel; and also as an independent movie. Jagshemash!!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206494/?ref_=tt_urv
 Classic borat, but HDR is to dark to view,3,1,2,jtwhissel,25 October 2020,Same borat humor but whoever did the HDR edit of the movie did not watch it. 30% of scenes are to dark to see what's going on. Reminded me for the last episode of game of thrones,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205825/?ref_=tt_urv
 An Enjoyable Character in an Mediocre Sequel,10,1,2,kjproulx,25 October 2020,Being a huge fan of Borat from 2006 and thinking it was a very clever film; given how uncomfortable certain scenes may have been to watch; I was eagerly awaiting the sequel that was secretly filmed earlier this year. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm (and the rest of the title that I'm not filling in for this review) may not be anywhere as funny or as original as its predecessor; but for the time being; there are a few very memorable moments. The first film was a satire on society but done so in a way that is sort of timeless. This sequel plays off of too many things happening in 2020 to really feel like it could be a long-lasting film. This film is all over the news and I'm sure it'll be popular for the next few weeks; but I simply can't see it being talked about ten years from now.Borat is a character played magnificently well by Sacha Baron Cohen and follows him on his journey through the United States; exposing the most disgusting aspects of it. This sequel is no different from that; except the plot of the film itself gets a little lost in translation at times. The film begins with Borat being given a mission to deliver a monkey to Vice President Michael Pence but then evolves into him having to connect with his daughter and possibly deliver her to him instead. Along the way; this film has some fun with the two of them wandering around; but I found this sequel to be far too heavy in terms of politics. All this film wanted to do was expose how corrupt the political scene is in the United States and I felt like it was too much at times.With all of that said; there are a couple of moments in particular where I found myself wondering how he didn't end up in jail for doing/filming such things; so props to him for pulling it all off. Sadly; I think even certain scenes took things too far and I wasn't exactly laughing; but feeling more uncomfortable; which is probably what their goal was. From incest jokes to luring older men into hotel rooms; this film just goes for it and doesn't hold back. Again; I give it all the props in the world for that; but I won't remember it for being as clever and unique as the first. This film deserves praise for pulling off a sequel in today's climate; but honestly not much more in my opinion.Sacha Baron Cohen is absolutely fantastic at playing this character and that's what makes these films so enjoyable; However; after seeing him in films like Hugo and more recently in The Trial of the Chicago 7; sure; his knack will always be in comedy; but I think he needs to broaden his horizons a little more. Even in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm; he shows off his dramatic talents as well; which makes me wish I could see him more dramatic films. Maria Bakalova plays his daughter Tutar in the film and I thought she actually did a great job portraying a character related to Borat; but I thought her character; although the heart of the movie itself; worn thin by the end. Their bond together worked for me; but it felt like a weird balance between sentimental and humourous and that just clashed for me.Overall; Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is far more controversial than the first in terms of the content; but also less funny and less shocking; so I'm not exactly sure I can give it a recommendation; especially if you didn't see the first film and at least enjoy watching it. These are films that are made for a specific audience and if you know it's not for you; I'd take that advice from yourself. I love the first Borat film and that's why I found this one mildly amusing; but I truly can't get myself to give it any high praise. I chuckled throughout the majority of it; but I felt like I was also forcing myself to a few times. It's not necessary to watch; but if you're already a fan then it's worth a watch. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is now streaming on Prime Video.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205760/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat "Saturated" Moviefilm,3,1,2,ansharora-12638,25 October 2020,I loved Borat and I even loved parts of this movie too. All the political satire; the jokes on women and jews; everything was great. But it felt a little like Saturated Borat because they added a character of his daughter. It was not a 'Borat' movie. You can say that even in the first part there was a reporter with him. But still it was a 'Borat' movie. In this movie; the girl has been given too much time on screen and that saturated the regular Borat a bit. It's my opinion. If you think the same then like the review.Cheers.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204801/?ref_=tt_urv
 A Well-Orchestrated Cringefest Lands a Bit Too On-The-Nose,7,1,2,artemis84-1,24 October 2020,Welp - I went for it. I watched the very much hyped "Borat 2"; which is available for free for Amazon Prime members and premiered yesterday. I put my cringe PPE hazmat suit on first because just like its predecessor; this "moviefilm" very much relies on sometimes painfully cringey; uncomfortable situations in order to relay its social commentary.Although I appreciate the talented Sacha Baron Cohen's work and admire his very vocal criticism of Facebook and the spread of misinformation; the Borat-type genre was never my cup of tea so to speak. But given the now infamous Giuliani incident; the masochist within me decided to watch the whole thing and decide if the screenshots I saw were really as bad as I thought or a clever marketing ploy.Well; they were both. It definitely hyped up the movie even more; and yes; Giuliani is totally inappropriate and gross with Maria Bakalova; the actress playing Borat's 15-year-old daughter; Tutar.Bakalova (24); did a phenomenal job. Originally from Bulgaria; she has not had any major roles until now. It must have taken not just a significant amount of talent/skill; but also quite a lot of courage to agree to this risky venture and her character outshone Borat's.For me personally; the movie was just not as great as its predecessor. It lacked the originality and 'unscripted feeling' the first Borat film brought with its shock value. Although this still had plenty of shock value; it was obvious that it was orchestrated and that took away from me seeing it as Borat vs. Sasha Baron Cohen in character trying to convey a social commentary.Worth a watch; just make sure to wear your cringe protective gear. You will need it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201451/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat picked precisely the right time to return,1,1,2,TheVictoriousV,23 October 2020,When Sacha Baron Cohen puts on his mask; he removes everyone else's. Often mistaken for mere racist caricatures; his stereotypical characters serve to confirm the biases of his unwitting documentary subjects (usually the voting American public and sometimes the very officials they've elected); effectively catfishing them into revealing even uglier sides of themselves.Unfortunately; his character of Borat is too well-known (and over-quoted) to make another pseudo-realist "prank film" without getting caught. That is; at least under the Borat Sagdiyev moniker (even as his latest film was produced pretty secretively). What if; oh I dunno... Borat himself was to put on disguises?As confirmed by 2018's Who is America; Cohen does still know how to dupe voters; celebs; and public figures into unleashing their worst selves; and this extra-layered bit of trickery is no exception. Following the early screenings; Cohen's latest prank was already making headlines; having caught cybersecurity advisor Rudy Giuliani in the act of doing something not-much-better than that which he himself has attempted to ruin the Biden family for.In the movie; Borat's near-feral and supposedly underaged daughter; Tutar (Maria Bakalova); joins the Kazakhstani reporter on his second trek to the United States; meeting such figures as Mike Pence and the aforementioned Giuliani on the way. Thing is; since Giuliani is one of Cohen's victims; he is not a part of the film's fiction (the same way Borat and his daughter are) - thus; when taking Tutar's in-universe age as fact and nevertheless "enjoying" her in his sleeping quarters; he isn't acting. Even if you don't share Cohen's biases; Giuliani having this sort of kerfuffle is a gloriously poetic bit of comedy.I don't know that this boner (pun intended) will delegitimize criticisms of the Biden family; but I feel a great swell of pity for Giuliani; mainly because his top defenders include Mike Cernovich; ever selective with when he chooses to call out pedophilia (jokes on Twitter is usually what does it; not the actual act). In a defense of Giuliani; Cernovich asked why we don't investigate Cohen - who; in the same footage; also seemed to believe Bakalova was no more than 15 and still made it possible that Giuliani brought her to his bed (by writing it so that Tutar will do anything to become "next Queen Melania").First of all; the actress isn't actually 15. Second of all; Cohen was in-character as Borat; who does have a 15-year-old daughter in the form of the character portrayed by said actress. The only party who conceivably believed that Tutar was a real-life minor is the politician who tried to f-ck her; i.e. the person currently being defended by "righteous; free-thinking reporters".Basically; Cohen continues to stand out among contemporary comics. Matt Zoller Seitz summarized the film's mission as "positioning its hero as a depraved; narcissistic fool whose flaws and excesses mirror his clueless targets' so closely that they don't realize they're being made fun of; even when Cohen stops just short of hauling out a sign that reads; 'YOU ARE THE JOKE'." He also eloquently describes the film's ultimate point on America: "For all its posturing as The Greatest Nation on Earth; the United States circa 2020 has more in common with a retrograde foreign backwater than its government or people like to admit."Much of Cohen's Borat shtick has always been about how; on top of pretending to affirm the beliefs of bigots; the bogeyman said bigots like to rail against isn't that far removed from themselves (in terms of how they view gender roles or religion or whatever); which becomes especially obvious when they actually start BONDING with the Borat figure. Notice how I've gone this far without mentioning mankinis or goofy catchphrases (or the beautifully idiotic way in which Borat combats the Coronavirus). Just so the detractors (and certain fans) are clear that there's more to this IP than they realize.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198577/?ref_=tt_urv
 Garbage,3,5,24,alidunford,2 November 2020,Waste of time! Not even funny. Loved the first movie. But this one was absolute trash.. just wanted some comedy with out the politics.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6230942/?ref_=tt_urv
 Pre scripted drivel,1,5,24,keithbet,31 October 2020,Borat 2006 was great; until it found out to be mostly scripted with a few real gags.Borat 2020 is undeniably mostly scripted. There is no ways Cohen would be able to get away with what he does without being sued.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6221774/?ref_=tt_urv
 Great movie,1,5,24,vete-58209,23 October 2020,I'm so glad we finally got a sequel; this is something everyone wanted but that couldn't be done because everyone already knew about Borat at that point.This was the perfect movie that we needed during the pandemic and It's a masterpiece,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6197340/?ref_=tt_urv
 Disappointed story line,10,6,31,noeljoshu,27 October 2020,The film started slow and ended very slow and at the end could not make head nor tail out of it. The first part was a fantastic movie but this was a disappointment. Even the picturization is so dull and gloomy even in outdoor shots. Content is good but the story line and is awful.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6210777/?ref_=tt_urv
 No where close to original,6,4,18,mayerdt,1 November 2020,If you like the first your going to watch it.. just taper your expectations because its nowhere as good. Mostly scripted and a lot less candid humor.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6223919/?ref_=tt_urv
 The Ultimate Troll is back !!!,5,4,18,blacksheepscreaming,23 October 2020,Here is a huge 10 from me;to the man with balls of steel. I didn't expect anything;especially not to live up to the first movie. Yes there are some parts that are maybe dragged out or could be replaced with other pieces to be more funny and dynamic;but all in all the movie is brilliant. It is another type of Borat movie.
As for the political views i might not exactly share them with Sacha as i do not live in the West;but since when should that stop appreciating genius comedy ?
Sacha has done it again !,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199042/?ref_=tt_urv
 Like minded individuals,5,3,12,bramwellrichmond,3 November 2020,Although I may be a minority voice I feel this wasn't a touch on the original film.
Cohen has always been quite political in nature. Irrespective he has largely subverted his views and let the comedy speak for itself. With the exception of a handful of laughs I found it depressingly obvious where he was headed. For all those not old enough to have watched Da Ali G Show on Channel 4 in the UK it was a surprising mix of both highbrow and lowbrow comedy loaded into a tightly spoken paraphrase. He didn't care who he made fun off it crossed all political and non political boundaries. Now unfortunately I think he is only happy to be politically incorrect when it validates his political correctness to left learning audiences. I'd still be happy to watch his next attempt; but please don't dumb it down for your audience.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6232931/?ref_=tt_urv
 A hilariously over-the-top sequel that doesn't quite match up to the original! [+71%],8,3,12,arungeorge13,24 October 2020,Although better structured from a narrative standpoint; Borat Subsequent Moviefilm lacks the authenticity of the first. But oh boy; can Sacha Baron Cohen (who plays the titular character) and Maria Bakalova (who plays Tutar; Borat's 15-year-old daughter) make you laugh your guts out! While this is very much a movie about Borat's ridiculous antics (and disguises); its emotional core is centered around Tutar. Bakalova is sensational here; as the "daughter-in-a-cage" who accidentally smuggles herself to America (even getting a full-blown character arc).The political commentary here is spot on too; and it leaves you wondering how much of those scenes were actually prompted. It even packs in deliciously over-the-top cameos from Mike Pence (crashing his CPAC speech); Rudy Giuliani (in a career-killing; compromising scene); and Tom Hanks (in a totally wild COVID-19 moment!). The film unleashes the characters of Borat and Tutar onto the American streets; letting them evolve and have realizations gradually. Baron Cohen's ability to expose the xenophobia; bigotry; and misogyny of (certain sections of) Americans is par none; honestly; it doesn't intrigue you at all in 2020. In fact; he trolls everyone and everything from data-stealing Facebook to people's obsession with cosmetic surgeries; denial of climate change; the Saudi Arabian stand on women's rights; flat-Earthers; and more.The obvious difference between the original and the sequel is that while the former wasn't a flat-out activist film; the latter more or less is. It even has a closing card that says "Now vote; or you will be execute". The earlier portions of the film; however; has all the Borat shenanigans you need - like Borat acquainting himself with smartphones; sending messages on fax; meeting an Instagram influencer; a "misunderstood abortion" scene; and rolling out a wholesome WTF! moment at a debutante ball. Alongside the humor; what works is Tutar's journey to free herself from patriarchal chains while Borat discovers he is just a few notches below the American conservative.All said and done; Borat Subsequent Moviefilm will have a shorter shelf life owing to the current political climate (and the elections) as opposed to the forever-memorable first film. Even if it's just a film for 2020; I'll take it as it is. It's a 95-minute laughter fest and one that'll make you forget you're living in a world that's more worthless than Borat's.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200605/?ref_=tt_urv

 My new number one comedy film!,7,2,7,rlgodchaux,25 October 2020,This film has officially usurped my favorite comedy 'Neighbors;' the Belushi one not the recent one.
Sacha manages to spin several subs themes and spins them all to a perfect conclusion that shows the absurdity of each one.
The performance by Maria is absolutely unbelievable and I wish I had a girl like her around when I was raising he*l in my younger days. She is ice cold and doesn't miss a beat.
Few people give Sacha the respect he deserves....he is absolutely brilliant.
BTW. Wanna discover if you are a truly independent thinker or just one who's desperate to belong to a side.....
I have the answer for you. IF YOU ENJOYED THIS MOVIE IRRESPECTIVE OF YOUR POLITICAL VIEWS; YOU ARE AN INDEPENDENT THINKER.
IF NOT; YOU ARE A MORON SEEKING TO BELONG TO a GROUP. Nothing more; nothing less!
That's true for both sides of the political spectrum.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206615/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not bad,5,2,7,am-by,23 October 2020,Some genuinely funny moments which isnt easy as its a reheated formula. Some scenes were not so nice as cohen seemed to exploit innocent and nice people. The rudy scene in the hotel while news media blockbuster was a complete honey trap. Yes overall the guy is a sleaze bag. But constantly touching him on the knee and buttering him up seductively before inviting him into the bedroom for a drink. She pulled his shirt up unmiking him; leaving him needing him to tuck back in. No doubt he thought he was onto an sexual encounter but only because she led him strongly to feel that way. Why barge in; why not let the camera keep rolling and really catch him in an expose. Cohan always takes the easy option with easy targets. Its funny at times but not serious movie making. Candid camera on steroids. I almost felt sorry for guiliany and thats saying something considering his lack of character.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200227/?ref_=tt_urv
 Was ok, but not as good as 1st one,1,2,7,WatchAndSmile,23 October 2020,I like Sasha and his movies. I am not sure I enjoyed this one. It was mostly fake and I could see it. With previous movies; there was way more real content. I get it; everyone knows borat these days so it's hard to find clueless people. It's just 95% of the content was fake/staged. The joke lines were not bad;especially in the beginning;but by middle; there was very little.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199977/?ref_=tt_urv
 Disappointing,1,4,20,martin_eidissen,27 October 2020,The original Borat film for a masterpiece. Sacha Baron Cohen is; to me; the best comedian of his generation along with Dave Chappelle. The problem with this sequal was that it was very far between the hilarous moments. Yes; a lot of it was funny in the case that it could make you smile a little; but there was only like one or two scenes that made you burst out in laughter. In comparison; the first Borat film was completely hilarious all throughout. I had quite big expectations for this sequel; and when the closing credits came up I just sat there feeling oddly disappointed. Obviously a must watch for many reasons; but don't expect a masterpiece; because it isn't one.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6210774/?ref_=tt_urv
 The movie we all need in 2020.,10,3,14,SnobReviews,23 October 2020,Wild; controversial; crude as ever and unapologetically hilarious; "Borat Subsequent Moviefilm" showcases Sacha Baron Cohen's comedic brilliance and his timing couldn't be better.In this sequel to the 2006 comedy hit; journalist Borat Sagdiyev once again travels to America; this time with his daughter in the midst of Covid-19 and the 2020 presidential election.Who knew that after 14 years; we'd need Borat more than ever. This much anticipated sequel is more raw and honest than the first. I mention this because you might not laugh as hard as you did in 2006; but what SBC brings to viewers is his sharp insight to a misguided American culture. This sequel is less documentary and more of a firm storyline. SBC is without a a doubt a master of his craft and huge props to him for finding newcomer Maria Balakova; who plays his daughter. Balakova if anything; steals the film. She's hilarious and her antics are acute and unexpected. If you think the Giuliani incident is bad; that's just the tip of the iceberg. It's takes balls to make a film of this nature during a pandemic but only SBC could pull something like this off. A brilliant comedy that's not only funny but has a ton of heart at its core; it's the movie we all need in 2020.
Stream it now for a VERY NIICCEE movie.

 Borat exposing the Americans for the idiots they are !,2,4,22,valleyjohn,26 October 2020,Was dropped on the public on very short notice and In these Covid times when big movies aren't being released ; it's definitely very welcome .
Sasha Baron Cohen was never going to be able to match the the first film for one simple reason and that is that everyone in America now recognised him.
The way he has got around the undercover stuff is to have his daughter do lots of the set pieces and it works quite well .
Maria Balakovo who plays Tutar the daughter ; is really good .Cohen is again taking the piss out of the right wing American public and it seems an easy thing to do .
Their prejudices are always bubbling just underneath which makes it extremely easy to prize out - whether that be sexism ; homophobia or racism .The whole film builds up to a quite remarkable interview with Rudy Giuliani .
It's an incredibly cringeworthy scene where you start of thinking what a nice man he is and then he stars to spew the lies we are at accustomed to hearing but that's not the worst of it . He is led into the hotel bedroom where he proceeds to be seduced by a Borats daughter . God knows what he would have done if it was allowed to carry on .This is obviously not as good as the first film because it's not a new format and it could do with more undercover scenes instead of the silly storyline sketches but I did laugh several times and that's rare for comedy film in the last few years .,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6209068/?ref_=tt_urv
 It's alright,10,2,8,ajkithefirst,26 October 2020,Underwhelming but funny... not as funny as the 1st borat but it's great to see some political commentary I guess.. Still pretty funny and topical but doesn't get anywhere close to the first borat.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207062/?ref_=tt_urv
 Entertaining but mostly scripted I think,9,2,8,Yvie81,23 October 2020,It was funny at times but the surprise factor of Baron-Cohen being able to play a character which; back then in the first film; wasn't recognised as being Baron-Cohen pranking people; was obviously gone in this film. It constantly made me think which scenes were real and which ones were staged? I honestly believe most of the scenes were scripted this time. I think the people involved weren't actors; but most of the scenes must have been scripted. I mean you could basically just see it by the bad acting! Except probably for the public scenes during the 'anti-covid' rally; the CPAC conference and the interview with Guiliani. But this just made the story a bit weaker in my opinion. On the other hand; the scenes where those American yanks were just basically making a fool out of themselves were entertaining nevertheless! 😏,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199850/?ref_=tt_urv
 Funny-ish,6,2,8,lewisriolu-35146,23 October 2020,Although I'd love to review this with rose-tinted glasses I'm not going to. I laughed about 25 times during this movie which isn't terrible but it just isn't up to par with the First Movie.
Some scenes were flat out disgusting. The Hall/Period Scene was This movie at it's lowest point. It's a 5 out of 10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199839/?ref_=tt_urv
 Disgusting,6,4,23,ljones172-223-130401,2 November 2020,Borat is the biggest POS I have ever watch. This isnt funny just a stupid film to help the millennias deal with life.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6230974/?ref_=tt_urv
 Stupid,5,4,23,schenkel-austin,2 November 2020,I guess people will do anything for money now a days.. 1st one was just plain dumb this one is even dumber. When he tried to dress up as Trump; he didn't look anything like him and he didn't even try to sound like him.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6230966/?ref_=tt_urv
 Americans are Inward looking !,4,4,23,paul_obe,23 October 2020,Watching this from Australia I'm glad everyone can finally see how inward looking America really is . United States ? Yer right ....Great movie ; very funny ; gotta love the Cinderella cartoon rip off lol,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198764/?ref_=tt_urv
 Funny,6,3,16,janinespampinato,23 October 2020,Funny. I enjoyed it. Can't wait to watch it again.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198899/?ref_=tt_urv
 Oh dear!!!,2,4,25,hoohaa79,2 November 2020,What me and my girlfriend knew about SBC before watching this movie.Politically left leaning (like most of the Hollywood elite); has TDS.Made millions from his movies and tv by way of offending people; but ironically is a staunch supporter of increased censorship of the internet especially across all social media platforms.
Now we have no issue with comedians offending people; freedom of speech and expression is something we value a great deal.
But we do have an issue with his sheer hypocrisy.That said; we have both enjoyed his films over the years
While Borat wasn't our favourite; it was still edgy and cool.
This movie; is not edgy and cool.
It's way more scripted; and by the time we reached 35 minutes we had lost hope and interest.If you are not politically active we still don't think many who saw his first movie would find this anywhere near as good; in fact parts of it was absolute cringe...and not in a good way.
If you are politically active (Republican; Conservative) then you will quickly see that this film is a rushed hatchet job spewed out during the election campaign.First timers; particularly the younger generation might giggle a little (not much); but older viewers who know how funny he can be will just feel sheer disappointment.It's an abortion of a movie; just glad we didn't have to pay for it exclusively as we have Amazon Prime.If you are also left leaning then perhaps you will enjoy the digs at Trump; Pence and Giuliani; but they are just political digs and not that funny at all.
In doing so SBC alienated half of the politically active audience; but the movie isn't funny enough to fully engage the other half either.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6230829/?ref_=tt_urv
 Disappointing,6,2,9,theforceofsu,7 November 2020,I went in expecting this movie to be worse than the first one; becausw let's face it that how usually films are; but it was by far worse than i ever thoight. There were some funny scenes; but i only laughed maybe three times. It all looks forced and honestly; it is the worst Cohen production i ever watched. It is not an age thing either; "Who is America" was made just one or two years ago and it was hilarious. This looks like it was written and filmed very fast just for the sake of filming it.Should you watch it? Honestly; don't. If you are a major fan; especially then. Better go watch "Who is America".,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6243410/?ref_=tt_urv
 Excellent movie, entertaining, eye opener, political satire,5,2,9,bryarfattah,25 October 2020,Another excellent movie from Sacha Baron Cohen. As a father I loved Borat's acting with his "daughter" Tutar; and have watched it 3 times.The rehearsed dancing; music; jokes; entertaining scenes and THAT usual shocking scene from Sacha will make you jump and get excited like you are watching a thriller.Great Success!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206557/?ref_=tt_urv
 mind-blowing tense hilarious shocking genius,7,2,9,ajikude,25 October 2020,Sasha as Borat does it again. Less is more almost. Less meetings but more massive the shock and cringe and exposé he makes of the deep underbelly of good and bad in America and American politics. I surprised he didn't get arrested with his "daughter". Imagine if Rudy Guliani sued them and the judge said ok "play the tape"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205651/?ref_=tt_urv
 Disappointing,9,2,9,peconomeas,24 October 2020,Being a huge fan of Borat; I was anticipating for this film. Cliche jokes; (cell phone and facetime puns; in 2020? Really?); bad scripting; and an unimaginative plot; didn't do the trick for me. Felt way too forced and way too much political. I understand he wanted to do an anti-Trump movie; and release it before the elections; but this is Borat. This is not the Cohen TV show. Borat is a figure that we enjoyed world wide and was the sarcasm of the capitilistic West and the former Soviet; looking for a modern identity; wannabe capitalistic but still Soviet East. He could have made an anti-Trump TV movie instead; and promote it as such; and yes; then; it would be funny and great. But for a Borat movie; an international release; it's a NO.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202200/?ref_=tt_urv
 Disappointing as a non-American,9,2,9,Harlequin_07,24 October 2020,There was some funny bits but if you're not American or interested in American politics it's a bit of a disappointment compared to the first one. The first one was about Borat and his crazy adventures; this one was about current American politics with Borat. Might have been funnier as a series rather than a movie.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201927/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not so good the devil's the around,6,2,9,bcshit,24 October 2020,It's pretty clear that the character hasn't been practiced and that it's almost like he's doing an impression of him own character. That what happens when you leave something like this for so long.There are a few funny bits but it's pretty disappointing of your expecting the old Borat.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200347/?ref_=tt_urv
 doesn't have the same feel anymore.,6,3,17,liveaholic,1 November 2020,Feels a bit too fake; and nobody in the film even gets that upset. Da Ali G Show was amazing; because you could tell he was simply sitting in a room with REAL people and they had no idea they were a part of the joke.
I enjoyed the first Borat film; but this one just feels too unrealistic to me. It's possible the bits were all with people who had no idea this was Sacha Baron Cohen; but i sincerely doubt it. The dialogue and things people say seem much more rehearsed than bits on Da Ali G Show.Sure; the social commentary is interesting; and I like that Cohen still doesn't shy away from any topic. But the "shock value" in this film consists of a lot of gross/ridiculous scenes with him & his daughter; where the meat & potatoes of Borat should be his interactions with everyday people. Just my $.02 on a mostly forgettable movie.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6227599/?ref_=tt_urv
 6,7,1,3,Edvis-1997,3 November 2020,This wasn't bad but... After 14 years a lot of things have changed and the issue is in the first movie they could make more aggressive;racist;dark humour than they can do now. Film is still nice despite that. They had idea; they stick to it. Another con or issue I see in this movie is giving more attention to women. I loved first Borat movie because it made fun of women and now when they praise women they are losing main point and attention... In my opinion; they could've waited a little bit longer and create better script for this movie; because first movie was masterpiece and this only Meh which is really disappointing.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6234096/?ref_=tt_urv
 Tasteless, hateful satire with a chuckle or two.,6,1,3,st-shot,30 October 2020,In his latest film Sach Cohen reprises his Borat character from a dozen years back in this crude smug comedy that will have one side cheering the other side ignoring. There is no denying its share of outrageously funny moments but minus the new target it is simply a stale dozen year old routine in which the mockery has taken on a more mean spirited tone than before.The plot revolves around getting Jimmy the Chimp to VP Mike Pence in the US. The disgraced Borat is chosen to deliver him but his daughter stows away eats the simian and creates other headaches for her father; enabling Borat to mock and humiliate (save for precious PCs) his usual suspects.Cohen returns to his career peak by reprising a character best dealt with in small doses and well past its prime. He does have tools to outrage comically and does so but the shock of it a dozen years back is not even a surprise now. The scatology; below the belt humor and endless dopey responses are about as fresh as a Beavis and Butthead re-run.Cohen; clearly playing to a target audience seems more venal this time around utilizing Trump for his own running of the Jews and more or less exposing his own slanderous tactics. Amazingly he does just that in the final scene before sentimentally signing off with a film dedication to Judith Dim Davis; a holocaust survivor featured in the films most (only?) touching and eloquent scene. She passed away before the film was released so we'll never know how she felt about sassy Sach being slugged in the groin or taking a dump in front of Trump Tower. A mean spirited; crass satire; sadly evocative of the people and the age. Now.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6218356/?ref_=tt_urv
 Funny,6,1,3,freddyleyton,26 October 2020,Mostly funny especially the political parts otherwise ok,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207313/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not very good,6,1,3,johnbell863,26 October 2020,Borat was a phenomenon. Now it has to be referred to as "the first Borat" because of this sub-par sequel. Everything is predictable and on the nose; and the unpredictable parts are just plain stupid. We all deserved better.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206834/?ref_=tt_urv
 Good,4,1,3,mfellipecampos,25 October 2020,I loved the movie; wow I love Sasha's movies; and this one was no different; I laughed a lot; the guy is great; speechless for this movie; everything I said will be little to praise; if you are thinking of watching it; do not waste time.Film seen on October 24; 2020.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206404/?ref_=tt_urv
 Prefer it to the first.,5,1,3,billiejoesmum,25 October 2020,Warning: Spoilers!I actually think this is the better film/movie. It relies less on toilet & vulgar humour to embarrass unsuspecting victims; and on more (in comparison!) subtle commentary on human behaviour and attitudes to deceive people into exposing their own views and reactions.The 'moon blood dance' went wayyyy too far. Without being too frank; even a woman/girl from a poor country wouldn't allow herself to deliberately leak through to the point of spoiling an expensive dress that would be extremely special for her. It just isn't that messy unless you don't use protection.
I know it's for comedic effect; I just think it was more crass than funny and spoilt the tone of the film (even with all it's anoos jokes).The rest was pretty clever though.The pro-life pastor being more interested in saving the "baby" than Borat seemingly admitting to sexual assault; child abuse & incest; the plastic surgeon nodding along to his description of the 'jew nose' and happily telling Borat what he recommends doing to his daughter's body whilst not directing any of the consultation to her until she asks if he'd 'sex attack' her; the dress shop owner just laughing when he asks for a 'no means yes' dress; his hosts openly admitting that they think that the Clintons drink children's blood and that Democrats shouldn't have rights; then later claiming that the Holocaust is a hoax (!); his song at the rally with the audience all happily singing back that various people should be injected with 'Wuhan flu' (that 2s ago they sang was a hoax) or chopped up like Saudi's; and the whole Rudi interview... all set up some very shocking; but funny & clever ways of exposing some of the extreme beliefs and behaviours towards certain people that permeate through society.Only the Instagram influencer is listed in the credits; and they mention that they explained in advance to the elderly holocaust survivors (that would have been rather cruel); so I can only assume that the others were being themselves on camera.The timing was just right for this sequel; with Covid & the US election in 10d. I'm not sure if they jumped on the opportunity to use Covid as a plot line; or it was just a coincidence that they were already filming; but it was a great way of showcasing some of the crazy things going on.Baron Cohen has a great talent for taking a silly character & a silly story and using them to create a clever narrative on the things he gets to observe.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205500/?ref_=tt_urv
 GREAT SUCCESS,5,1,3,jonathanakcay,25 October 2020,Let's be honest; when the movie was first announced it was exciting to hear that Borat was returning on the big screen. The first movie was a near-perfect comedy that; to this day; has you laughing from beginning to end. How could a sequel even come close to that standard when damn near everyone knows who Borat the character is? After laughing my ass off for an hour and a half it's safe to say that Borat is back and better than ever. Cohen's ability as both an actor and a comedian shine brightest when he's exposing political and social climates. His ability to stay in character and push people's buttons to the max is remarkable; let alone the comedic elements of making fun of various groups. Look; I don't think anyone was expecting this movie to be nearly as funny as the first; that's why I have to give this movie a 9 if the original Borat is a 10 (in terms of sheer comedy).The first one is still funnier; maybe because I've grown up with it; but this movie is right behind it. Cohen deserves so much credit for making a movie this funny in the limited time it took them to film. In this day and age when genuinely funny comedies are as rare to find as gold this movie is a diamond. I can't remember the last comedy I watched that had me laughing like this throughout the movie. Yes; there are some "just ok" jokes; more-so than the original had; but I laughed just as hard during this movie as the original. If nothing else Borat related was ever released by Cohen after this I'd be completely satisfied.This movie surpassed expectations and Bulgarian actress Maria Bakalova deserves tremendous credit for her performance as Borat's daughter who has arguably funnier scenes than Borat does.Amazing movie; would be a 10/10 if the original Borat never existed.Chenqui,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205444/?ref_=tt_urv
 It isn't lovely as the first one.,5,1,3,sajjadfrahani,25 October 2020,I watched both movies in a row of two days; Yesterday I watched The first one;it was an AMAZING COMEDY MOVIE which talked about it's targets too. But now The Second one wasn't at least A Comedy ! I only liked to laugh at the first 20 mins and last 5 mins; The other parts was kind of Drama Or something like that. And also it wasn't like that Document-Style the first movie had. The Second movie had Some targets and some messages which wanted to give to The audience but those messages is kinda "Too Much Bold" and hadn't the cleverness of First Movie.
I liked it; But just For watch it only once. Of Course I won't recommend anyone to watch it and I would suggest They Make Their Love With The 2006's movie.
I was Hopeful for some lovely Things But I couldn't find In Our Subsequent Moviefilm.High Five!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205321/?ref_=tt_urv
 Funny but could have been better,5,1,3,andyphillips99,25 October 2020,US politics is just crazy; so it's the perfect anchor for satire. However simply bashing Trump and republicans and being politically one sided feels lazy and I feel like this movie could have been so much more if they'd explored the insanity on both sides of the US political divideInstead this feels kinda like "here's some laughs by the way vote Biden",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6204989/?ref_=tt_urv
 Nowhere near as good as the first, but that's to be expected.,5,1,3,Jeremy_Urquhart,24 October 2020,Borat was an absolute classic at the time of release; and I think it's still a fantastic comedy to this day; even if some people have probably tired of it. I'll stand by it being a provocative; gross; yet undeniably clever and hilarious satirical masterpiece; so the idea of a sequel not living up to that standard is understandable.There's a good deal in America at the moment for someone like Sacha Baron Cohen to make fun of; and while this isn't quite as good as his recent series Who Is America; there are a number of very funny sequences sprinkled throughout; especially in the film's second half. This is when the film shows Borat dealing with COVID-19 and the response to it within the USA; and is both funny and genuinely interesting as one of the first major movies to deal with the still very recent issue.There were a few parts here and there that made me laugh pretty hard; and a few sections that didn't quite land. It's not super consistent; and the humour definitely isn't as fresh as it once was. Still; if you like Sacha Baron Cohen's style of humour; you'll probably find some things to like here; and if not; this certainly won't convert you to being a fan;It's a solid enough sequel- may not have the staying power of the first; but I mostly enjoyed it; and am ultimately glad it exists.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202186/?ref_=tt_urv
 Doesn't come close to the original but still has its hilarious moments,2,1,3,arabnikita,24 October 2020,Jagshemash! In this movie; Borat goes back to America to save his country; prevent his execution and discover how the world has changed in 14 years. While this sequel is above many of our modern comedies; it doesn't come remotely close to the original for two reasons. The movie's main plot is too heavily focused on Trump; his buddies and politics overall which makes it feel boring and dry. The segments outside of the "main narrative" are hilarious in all the right ways but most of them feel scripted and inorganic.It is a challenging task to follow up the success; freshness and openness of Borat 1; specially considering that now he is a known character who has to wear disguises. The sequel does have a few "wild" moments; but overall it feels toned down and scripted. The Borat of old had zero filter and would tell things as they are to anyone he met not caring if he would offend anyone. People around him would show genuine reactions without acting like caricatures. This is what fans liked about the original and while the spirit is partially there; it doesn't feel as strong.Nevertheless; I still found a lot to enjoy about the movie and would definitely recommend it if you have seen the original. The plot is just as moronic as before with Borat and his daughter doing a lot of crazy things. The film is tightly packed and has many hilarious moments; not to mention an unexpected twist in the end which makes everything even funnier. Despite the boring political focus; it tries to touch up on as many things as possible like technology; feminism and Corona. I only wish they would have had a more interesting plot with juicier and outrageous content that would feel like the original.Movies.shmovies on Instagram,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201520/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not the same.,4,1,3,sonnysupremewilson,23 October 2020,I came into this extremely excited; but it didn't take long for me to realise that this film wasn't going to live up to the original. I'd probably say there were 3 actually funny; non-scripted scenes that made me laugh and maybe 1/2 chuckle-worthy scenes. Whereas the original had me laughing and shocked the whole way through; this one had me sitting waiting for something funny to happen. I knew the originals greatness couldn't be topped but this one really didn't hit the mark. A decent comedy but don't come expecting much if you've watched the original as it simply won't compare.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199710/?ref_=tt_urv
 All is good....exept the daughter spoils it,3,1,3,zosozoso,23 October 2020,I have been a SBC hardcore fan since 1997 and believe me when i say HARDCORE i mean it...........the first Borat was off the hook........but this one? eeeerm.............its an updated/same scripted version of the first one;exept the enemy is trump now;nearly same jokes........and the daughter? where do i start? talentless acting annoying accent and the whole vibe was that she never wanted to be in the movie..........i dunno i am split 50/50 i am glad to see another Borat...........but its outdated so to speak.........and btw why in gods name would they kill off Azamat??????????????? Ken Davitian stated in a recent interview he would star in any shape or form in Borat 2......but they killed him off? had it not been him SBC wont have won the golden globe,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6198331/?ref_=tt_urv
 Missed Opportunity,6,5,36,kmjnhh123,27 October 2020,So i have seen the first Borat film & it is very funny; so i was shocked when another Borat film was coming all these years later.I will start by saying that i think it really is a missed opportunity; with the Covid pandemic going around that did not help with filming in the first place; but the point i want to make is that the film is a political statement in quite a lot of areas; the film is based around politics & the next election with Trump & Biden.This was a bad idea; i don't want a Borat film that is trying to push a motive or suggest political things; what happened to the old classic Borat format. The film really does feel like its trying to be 2 things; one moment he is with a Priest saying that he put a baby into his daughter; which felt like classic Borat; then on the next clip the film is back to being about politics which didn't make me laugh; there was clips & segments that very classic Borat but for the most part i did not laugh anywhere as much as i did in the first film; first film Borat went around exploring the US; meeting different people & cultures; this new film totally a different vibe.Most of the film is about his daughter that he plans to give away as a gift to the leaders; again its for politics; if it was for a different reason then it could have been executed much better.I really think that he should of done a new film before the Covid pandemic & the re election or waited until the Covid is over so he can fully be in the Borat role which we loved; by all means if he wants to make a film about the election & politics then make another film; don't label it with the Borat format behave a lot of us didn't really enjoy it; my friends & family have even said its mot that great as the first.Age - 26Cinema: Amazon Prime MoviesWatch; Avoid; Consider: Do watch for small bits of laugh but you will wish it was different.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6210252/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,5,2,10,henry8-3,24 October 2020,Timely sequel to the 2006 hit given that it has released on Amazon weeks before the US election. After serving a long prison sentence; Borat is sent on a mission to the US to give his daughter to Mike Pence thereby increasing Kazakhstan's standing.Much the same as the original with plenty to enjoy; albeit the originality has passed; hence not the shocker the first one was. That said there are many wonderful swipes at Trump and his supporters incl the NRA; inherent racism; the belief in buzzwords and theatre rather than facts and the handling of COVID. Rudy Giuliani loses a lot of credibility here coming across as quite a creep (irrespective of who you vote for) it must be said - funny though.So ultimately quite a few laughs; some misfires but worth catching for the messages it sends.

 Kind of Made me Feel Old,6,3,19,TriggerPullerUSMC,29 October 2020,Years ago as a teen I watched Ali G and then from that came Borat. I would howl with laughter and I was really looking forward to this- I just got back from London last night due to work and was bummed I didn't have time to watch it right when it came out. I had planned to watch it with my fiancee in London because I was excited to see her reaction; she is a equity partner in a law firm there and oddly enough is probably the funniest person I know. She'd had never seen Borat but knew a bit about Ali G and as a London born and bred lady she likes Ali G. Anyhow that never happened it would have been good to get her opinion.It made me feel old because as much as I loved Sacha when I was a young teen I watched this expected to howl with laughter but it all felt so tired and old. sort of like Abbott ad Castello but a bit too try hard. I don't want to get in to revealing detail but ultimately it is the same predictable stuff we laugh at when we are 13; 14; 15 because it seemed edgy or grown up or something back then now it is just kind of like a episode of the Jackass movies with a script. Same kind of goofy humor.Anyhow; didn't see to be fun or different or edgy just seemed a bit lazy because they know stoners and teens will often laugh at fart jokes. So now I feel almost like a grown up and soon I'll be telling kids to get out of my yard. I know Cohen can do better he is brilliant and this seems repetitive. I bet it does big numbers though! So I can't be one of those people who say it wasn't funny because I don't get to decide what is funny or not. To me it wasn't funny and mostly because it is so much like the first one same cringe moment stuff.Anyhow; I hope you enjoy it and aren't like me; where you watch it and it just reminded you of more simple times when a fart jokes would make you laugh. Growing up and becoming an adult has those moments - when you realize you can't go back. Come on Mr Cohen grow with us and do some stuff that is smart like we know you can do. Doesn't have to be like Woody Allen smart- just not another version of the 3 stooges.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6214931/?ref_=tt_urv
 Just Ehh,2,3,20,bix-77217,30 October 2020,I loved the first one. Did not feel the same. It was a propaganda flick which was unfortunate.Some funny scenes. Boards daughter stole the show.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6217658/?ref_=tt_urv
 Kind of meh,2,2,11,usajoehawk,24 October 2020,A few decent laughs but the whole flick felt rushed and staged. I find it hard to believe anyone would be fooled by his characters now. It's a shame because the first Borat movie might of been one of the greatest theater experiences ever. Never laughed so hard before; the whole audience was nuts. the actress who played his daughter was the real highlight in this.I Felt the Giuliani scene was interesting but not insanely funny. The period dance and the pro lifer scenes were the best. I general feel the exploitation of the kindness of the redneck dudes who took him in during the Covid lockdown weak.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201955/?ref_=tt_urv
 A FEW GOOD LAUGHS BUT TERRIBLY SCRIPTED,6,2,11,Warren_Scott-55087,24 October 2020,IF YOUR LOOKING FOR RAW; TEAR DROPPING LAUGHTER FROM REAL REACTIONS TO BORATS MADNESS LIKE HE DELIVERED IN THE ORIGINAL; THEN YOU'LL BE AS DISAPPOINTED AS I WAS... IT'S NOT FUNNY WHEN THE TARGET IS IN ON IT... I'M SHOCKED THAT THIS COMIC GENIUS INSULTED THE INTELLIGENCE OF HIS FANS BY ALLOWING THIS TO BE SHOWN TO AUDIENCES.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201103/?ref_=tt_urv
 Sacha should be ashamed of this,8,3,21,Izzy_Z,2 November 2020,Meh. Obviously scripted and timed for a "certain event". Marginally watchable; and that's if you've had a few; with only a couple of funny moments. Sacha should be ashamed of this partisan sellout; all the more so; since as an englishman; he has no business interfering with any of it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6229503/?ref_=tt_urv

 I don't care about politics but this was just crap...,3,1,4,smediastudios,30 October 2020,I'm gonna keep watching to see it but 30 mins in and I'm like ah....idk if it's worth it! I loved the first one but that was a moment in time.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6217815/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat 2.0,3,1,4,Sickpuppy365,26 October 2020,Sacha Baron Cohen is arguably one of the hardest working actors out there; not in terms of the amount of work he churns out in a given year; but in his steadfast dedication to producing film that is as thought-provoking as it is cringe-inducing... Are you laughing with him; are you laughing at him; are you even laughing? I've been watching him since Ali-G first entered the house; and I've always felt uneasy whenever he is on-screen... You see; I'm not big on schadenfreude; I don't enjoy watching people being put on-the-spot; being made fun-of; squirming in their seats... In general it makes me feel sorry for them; and I feel a bit uneasy.
That being said; SBC takes the risks no one else seems to be willing to; and exposes the truths through satire that most people would prefer stayed hidden.
Is Borat 2; as I will call it for brevity's sake; better than Borat? In short no. It is a little less "laugh-out-loud" funny; it is also a little less vulgar (not saying that's a good thing); and a little less real feeling (probably a result of the first movie's success and SBC being way more recognized than before.)
However the addition of the lovely and talented Maria Bakalova (playing Borat's daughter; Tutar Sagdiyev); and the additional humanity; interactions; story-lines and character arcs that she brought with her performance helped to make up for all that.
I am giving 6 stars... And an additional .5 just for Maria... So 6.5 stars? Niiceeee! High five!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207245/?ref_=tt_urv
 ye sure,2,1,4,djurrepower,25 October 2020,Its still hard to see who is in on the joke and who isnt. but overall i had a few laughs. but again it swings back and forth between cringe and humor. with the new political landscape it brings some new ideas; but like the previous film; it will get dated very quick.5/10: ye ok,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6205676/?ref_=tt_urv
 Falters in authenticity of the original, but has its moments.,7,1,4,Airman87,24 October 2020,Sadly this film's directing style is more reminiscent of Cohen's later movie; The Dictator; than it is his earlier works of the original Borat prequel or Bruno. More focus feels given to the fictional being of our Kazakh characters than it does actual reality. At times it comes off too in-your-face with the scriptedness or blatant editing; so the film never gives a chance for reality and its genuine characters to breath with same earnest reactions as the original film.While the film starts and finishes with a heavy-handed partisanship; it does work surprisingly well for the script and in today's political scene. Unfortunately like all topical pieces; that also means this will not age well and be much forgotten.Overall; expect to get some cheap laughs; but don't expect the same original masterpiece.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201338/?ref_=tt_urv
 You have got to be kidding,2,3,23,inner_space-76317,1 November 2020,I'm not sure where the positive reviews come from but this just has to be the dumbest movie ever.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6227999/?ref_=tt_urv
 You not finna laaayke it. Flashlight,2,3,24,michaelinzitari,1 November 2020,Sooo disappointing. Watched it all to ensure I saw the twist and political message behind the movie. But for a movie labelled "comedy" it's not funny. It's crude teenage boy comedy that adults would cringe at. Disgusting beyond belief. Hardly made a sound watching this movie. No rolling on floor laughing moments. Any slightly good parts felt like déjà vu. Did not need a part II of this movie. If you want to see a euro comedy watch "Eurovision song competition". If you want to lose 2 hours of your life and learn nothing watch this.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6228026/?ref_=tt_urv
 Tries to hard, too much scripted scenes,3,2,13,westhoff_justin,24 October 2020,The movie doesn't have the great in the moment scenes that the first one had. Giving these ordinary people lines to read to advance the plot fall on it's face. Also frames entire scenes around trying to get "gotcha" moments from people that don't go anywhere or have a funny punchline. The daughter character is well acted and funny; but the movie definitely has an agenda behind it. The final 10 minutes are straight propaganda. The jokes about how backwards Kazakhstan is are hilarious; but the jabs at Americans are lazy and tired.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200799/?ref_=tt_urv
 Very nice sequel.,6,1,5,Andrew_Wiper,25 October 2020,It's not as funny as the first one but it's still damn funny. Borat's daughter is actually a scene stealer in this. I liked it. Sacha baron cohen is a comedic genius and he's just as funny in this one. I really liked the chemistry between these two. I'd watch Borat 3 in a second.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206350/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not as good as the first.,6,1,5,skylermoore,24 October 2020,I was so excited for the sequel to a movie I call one of my favorites of all time. However this sequel just fell really short. Its highs are very high but its lows are sooooo low. It seems extremely slow at times. As well as failing to meet the magic the first one had with the real world interactions. The ending is fantastic and makes me want another one but in the way the last 25 minutes are shot. Not the every minute before it. Funny? Yes. Boring? Also kind of yes.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201631/?ref_=tt_urv
 Deadhorse,10,2,16,mattm-40967,2 November 2020,Over and over again...beating that horse. We get it; Cohen doesn't like conservatives. Some parts are funny. Target everyone! Only redeemer is the people poked at fully accept Borat for who he is. They invite him into their homes treat him with respect. Same old story though. Gets aggravating.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6231556/?ref_=tt_urv
 Make Better But Still Stupid Moviefilm,8,2,16,Cineanalyst,2 November 2020,This is better than the first "Borat" (2006) movie. Sacha Baron Cohen seems to have learned two important lessons from the first overrated prank video. One; critics seemed to expect the movie to be a satire or an actual coherent commentary on something; which the first "Borat" wasn't; but some seemed to think it was. "Borat Subsequent Moviefilm" picks a real target for its pranking; as opposed to a a haphazard assemblage of spouting misogyny and racism with drunk frat boys; interfering with a local TV news station; destroying store merchandise; or randomly accosting people as before. He also defecated beside Trump Tower. From those humble beginnings; the exploitation of Trump politics this time around is far more concerted. The pandemic fits right in with this; too.Second; there seems to be less of Cohen humiliating; sexually harassing and chasing people. Indeed; some chase his Borat early on. Maybe there was less of him misleading and ambushing people; too; which may result in fewer lawsuits than followed in the wake of his first obnoxious tour. Filming a scene in what appears to be a public restroom; including one person's face being blurred out; indicating his lack of consent; is an exception and one instance of the series' continued toilet humor. I'm far less concerned over him interrupting a CPAC speech by Vice President Mike Pence or ambushing former New York mayor turned Russian-misinformation peddler Rudy Giuliani. One of my biggest complaints with the first movie was that he evidently included celebrity Pamela Anderson in on his joke--obviously; as he'd have gone to prison for that stunt otherwise--while he made fools of everyday people. Here; that's largely reversed; as President Trump's lackeys are heckled whereas at least some scenes with non-public figures are suspect of having been staged. Trump supporters; white supremacists and QAnon conspiracy theorists at one rally are an exception; but that does fit into the overall anti-Trump thesis."Borat" didn't work as satire or social commentary; either; due to Borat spouting more bigoted; homophobic; sexist and racist garbage than everyone else in the movie combined; and he did it in the disguise of an insulting characterization of someone from Kazakhstan. That's surely the reason the sequel includes some nauseating schmaltz regarding his relationship with his daughter. Borat learns to be not so anti-Semitic and hateful of women so as to punch harder at the right-wing political scene. Oh; it still hardly works; and the comedy remains juvenile; but it's an improvement.Hard to say it's a successful political takedown when Borat is lectured to by a supposed QAnon nut on sexual equality; or when he walks into a synagogue in an anti-Semitic costume. The Giuliani interview; the biggest coup of the picture; in particular; is a frustrating botched opportunity. I guess; at least; they get him to spout off about some conspiracy theory regarding the origins of the pandemic and; then; parody that and the QAnon junk rather humorously with the twist in the style of "The Usual Suspects" (1995). It's reminiscent of the better work "The Daily Show" and "The Colbert Report;" or Cohen himself; used to do by letting interviewees sink themselves. But; alas; that's short lived as Borat jumps out to scare Giuliani off. That many seem to focus on Giuliani with his hand in his pants instead of his ridiculous answers on the pandemic is quite indicative of the misplaced appreciation some seem to have for this series. Cohen sabotaged the key moment of his own movie. How asinine.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6231049/?ref_=tt_urv
 I give credit to the actress,5,2,16,Pukeonthestreet,2 November 2020,She was great. But making a joke about shootings in a time when they're actively happening is just f'd. Honestly I started off laughing at a few things then it just got dark and gross and the jewish jokes made me wish I never watched it. Upsetting.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6229582/?ref_=tt_urv
 Meh,4,2,16,taedirish,30 October 2020,Hard to believe it's been 14yrs and the Borat character is still just as recognizable today. In fact; it'sso recognizable that I'd argue it's impossible to believe all the bs stories about people suing because they felt tricked.
That being said; I just couldn't get the laughs from this film that I got from the original. I admit I found the actress playing the daughter super cute and both the main characters were talented; but the film relied so heavily on the same old jokes that I was barely able to muster a chuckle. For me; the primary laughs came from how ridiculous some of our political views sound when spoken out loud. I'd imagine too many people across the world they sound as ridiculous as they came across on screen.
Maybe I'm just older or too analytical not but I couldn't find the pranks as plausible as I did during the original.
With nothing else to do; it's a movie that passes the time but that's mostly all it is.
I'd imagine anyone who liked Borat is going to watch this and everyone else will pass; I can't imagine anyone being on the fence about this one...,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6219615/?ref_=tt_urv
 It was better then the first one,5,2,17,fujitv-63632,2 November 2020,Idk when u can ever say the second movie was better the the first one but this was the case sad to say I liked it but I didn't think they took the best approach on politics like they liked to play out in the movie as they made some scenes real life events and some choreographed how is the audience supposed to know Wuts real and not real other then thinking the whole movie is real staged hidden cam events even though it's not how are the audience supposed to know the difference this movie is misleading,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6229552/?ref_=tt_urv
 Woeful, unfunny and nasty,6,2,18,dereklambe,2 November 2020,I am normally a big fan of Sacha Baron Cohen; but he should be ashamed of himself for coming out with this dross. I am sure he will pretend it was a satire of patriarchy; but really it was just an excuse to demean women for cheap laughs.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6230957/?ref_=tt_urv

 It isn't outstanding,5,1,6,staunton-gary,3 November 2020,However; it was mildly entertaining. Too much reliance on subtitles; imo. Maria Bakalova (as Tutar) did an amazing job. I would recommend this to watch; but it isn't going to win any awards.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6232499/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious BUT,5,1,6,marimiller-82075,2 November 2020,Movie is hilarious except for 1 scene that is truly disgusting. Made me want to vomit. I had to close my eyes until it was over. Why do movie makers think they constantly have to push to film what is ugly or disgusting? Don't confuse innovation with disgusting. There is nothing noteworthy about it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6229150/?ref_=tt_urv
 Brilliant and timely,5,1,6,mbreretonme,25 October 2020,Whilst simplistic in its message the very charm is how deliberate it is ....and well executed. Plus funny. Cringe worthy at times of course. Tutar stands out. Cohen is an extraordinary talent.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206364/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious. Just what we need.,5,1,6,michael0845,25 October 2020,Very funny and many scenes to talk about with your friends. Do not believe the one-stars from those who were offended politically. If easily offended; you will be.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206324/?ref_=tt_urv
 Some laughs but overall strange.,5,1,6,jamesgifford-25216,24 October 2020,Some laughs but struggled to find the meaning of it all. The last film was more of a documentary.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201351/?ref_=tt_urv
 I remember now why I'm not a Borat fan!,5,2,19,yada2121,1 November 2020,Full of farcical prank jokes! And parodies of political incorrect jokes. After five years of Trump; this is not funny anymore. Political humor is just not my cup of tea.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6223515/?ref_=tt_urv
 Sometimes funny, sometimes not, but very predictable,6,1,7,efesjowanow,6 November 2020,I had some laughs; less than with original Borat; Bruno or Dictator. The problem was that he was going after predictable politically correct targets; not taking any risks like other comedians these days do.For example during the movie I could imagine just as funny situations and chants he could create if he was going after targets on the other end of the political spectrum.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6239201/?ref_=tt_urv
 Eh,5,1,7,drael64,3 November 2020,Maria stifles laughs throughout; which is not good for an undercover actor. There's a lot of deceptive cuts; etc. Borat doesn't really offer anything fresh apart from a little woke moralizing on the side. There are some cute moments - the old jewish lady; and the qanon flatmates; but like the first film I didn't find this particularly funny. I think I might actually prefer ali-g; something that was definitely coming from a more light hearted place than this film.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6232947/?ref_=tt_urv
 Have been a fan of SBC since ALI G,6,1,7,joeruffincanada,25 October 2020,Comparing any sequel to an A+ original is going to be difficult. Having said that; I loved it. I thought he did a great job; especially with the fact that halfway through production; the virus hit and must have changed his original plan for the movie. When I think about it; the only thing I would have liked more is if there were less parts of him playing Borat being disguised as somebody else. Because; I get he's an international celebrity; though the first film was 15 years ago; I think he could have gotten away with being Borat in public more. But it was hilarious with many wild moments. And his daughter; Titar; was outstanding; I would love a spin-off show or film just with her character. There is supposed to be much more great footage that wasn't in the film; so I hope for an extended cut; or a release with deleted and extended scenes.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6206417/?ref_=tt_urv
 Not as good as the first one,2,1,7,ztrzcinko,24 October 2020,Doesn't have the same charm as the first one. Focuses too heavily on current events and politics. It's essentially a long SNL skit.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202767/?ref_=tt_urv
 Make no Mistake - This Movie is about Human Trafficking,4,1,7,user-415-133374,23 October 2020,I really liked the first movie and I understand what Sacha Cohen is trying to do here. He had to top his first movie by making this one even more cruder and offensive than the first; and at that he succeeded. In the Borat style; the film is clever and some of his anecdotes are brilliant and hilarious (leading the viewer to think he is about to call Trump a bad President; for instance; only to then say Obama was the dictator and Trump was a Strongman Savior)With that said; there is also a very dark side of this film which essentially is that Sacha Cohen is making light and poking fun at human trafficking. The entire plot revolved around giving his daughter as a bride to a rich powerful man; and at several points Borat says he is "selling her to her new owner". She is made to live in a cage and at several points Borat says he has raped her simply because he wanted to and had gotten her pregnant as a result.Honestly; at least in my opinion; the film does go a little bit too far especially since the real Kazakhstan; as with many of the former Soviet republics; does have a very serious problem with human trafficking. I'm sure some people will say its only a movie; and they would be right; but what if there were scenes of the daughter getting beaten or raped by multiple men and forced into prostitution. That is the reality that this movie is essentially making fun of and it wouldn't be so funny then.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6200240/?ref_=tt_urv
 Political opinions matter if you like the actor...,10,1,8,mattgray-43022,26 October 2020,Republicans think denis miller; john voight and every other conservative a**hole in hollywood are gods with their bs and hyperbolics lies; but when an actor they disagree with ideologically makes them look stupid they cry and say their opinion doesn't matter... Almost like you're all hypocrites? Facts don't matter as long as I agree with the actor; and you wonder why you idiots elect ppl like trump? Good luck murica,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207194/?ref_=tt_urv
 Borat's Lost His Luster,10,1,8,smolkaville,24 October 2020,This one didn't have the same high brow; clever comedy as many of his other shows. Too partisan and not willing to go after everyone,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6203551/?ref_=tt_urv
 5/10,9,1,8,garylyons-91273,24 October 2020,A few laugh out loud moments; compared to the first nowhere near as good.
A lot of gags fall flat and felt forced.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201710/?ref_=tt_urv
 Had funny parts but to damn staged.,7,1,8,bosimmons-70376,24 October 2020,Okay; taking away every political thing about this movie out of it; it just wasn't as funny as the first with almost everything feeling staged. There was to much time spent between Borat and his daughter which isn't what borat should be about it's about him being funny and making people uncomfortable. I get it people recognized him and that can be difficult and with saying that then I'm sorry don't make another movie then. This looked like a crash grab and or a political hit job to just say what everyone already hears in movies now which is trump sucks; vote Democrat. Okay we get it now can we get back to making movies funny and good again. I'm not political and sometimes I just don't want to hear it all the time when I just wanna sit back and watch a movie. I'm saying that there where some funny moments like when he's stuck inside with those two men other then that everything felt like the people where told there was a camera and didn't make it authentic. It was just weird to see a sequel of a movie that was such a cultural phenomenon and then completely make it about politics I mean everything was and then also making it very staged. So; in conclusion it was okay some funny parts but overall if I was to tell you that another borat movie came out you would not expect this kinda movie at all. Also I'm kinda curious after this election how movies will be made if Biden wins because for the past five years we've heard and have seen the same jokes rehashed over and over so if he's not there anymore what will movies look like? Just a thought.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6201486/?ref_=tt_urv
 Meh,4,1,9,juanmpais,24 October 2020,I won't go super fancy critic here as I'm not an English speaker.The first movie was impressive; couldn't believe what I was watching. This time that shock won't happen and the movie just feels as easy 2020 dem propaganda. While Borat will last classic and atemporal; this will be remembered as a short term polytical campaign.Ps: still 6 as the jokes still kinda politically incorrect at least.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6202405/?ref_=tt_urv
 I expected good humor, i got toilet one,6,1,10,talemunja-92827,24 October 2020,First 15-20 minutes of the movie were promising; really good. Later; bad taste entered the scene..

 World full of morons,5,1,15,vsto-46698,5 November 2020,Anyone beyond the age of 3 who found anything remotely funny in this travesty or in the previous Borat movie is more intellectually shortchanged than the Trump Chumps. Hollywood has reached a new low. Yes; I loved the way it ridicules the fundamentalcase Klueless Kristian Kluxxers; & that is why it got a 2 rather than a 1 rating.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6237071/?ref_=tt_urv
 Old hat,5,1,15,stircrazysos,2 November 2020,As a Sasha baron Cohen fan. I'm was disappointed. He always pushes the boundaries; but this was "old hat".
From Ali g to the spy. The guy is genius. This film though was tripe. Same jokes; just rehashed. You can't play characters like Borat; ali g or bruno. More than once; the public won't fall for it. Such ashame; because the first borat film was great. Hence 4/10 come on Sasha you can do better.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6231258/?ref_=tt_urv

 Bold, hilarious and thought-provoking,5,0,1,gionniblas,8 November 2020,Having watched all of Sacha's previous work; I knew exactly what to expect; yet this film still managed to surprise me from beginning to end.
It is absurdly funny. 15 minutes in; my whole body already hurt from laughter!This film takes a clear stand on political matters - much like the TV mini-series "Who Is America?" - which has angered many Conservative viewers. I suspect this to be the reason why the movie is being massively underrated. In my opinion; it was the boldest; most relevant move Cohen could have made in the current political climate; and he didn't disappoint.A brilliant addition to the second installment of "Borat" is actor Maria Bakalova; who incredibly matches Sacha in energy; acting skills and dedication to her part.
The unfair treatment of minority groups; right-wing political extremism and conspiracy theories are the main themes of discussion in Borat's Subsequent Moviefilm; all linked by a surprisingly emotional plot that dives into Borat's relationship with his daughter Tutar (played by Bakalova).In the midst of a pandemic; the creatives and crew involved managed to deliver us a heartfelt; politically critical; hilarious; poetic and well-executed piece with the power to make people question their behavior and challege authoritarian figures in real-life.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6246496/?ref_=tt_urv
 Hilarious and relevant.,6,0,1,baybaganz,8 November 2020,It is amazing the lengths Sacha Baron Cohen and co star Maria Bakalova go to for the sake of comedy. They are relentless and I was in cracking up the whole time. The film also has heart and good intentions. Loved it.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6245552/?ref_=tt_urv

 Lacks the freshness of the original but needs to be seen even if to see Rudy Giuliani "tucking in his shirt".,5,0,9,chris_hick01,6 November 2020,Shamed former Kazakh TV presenter Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is given a second chance by the President of Kazakhstan (Dano Popescu) and seek out President Trump in the US of A. His daughter; Tutar (Maria Bakalova) tags along in search of "Princess" Melania. His journey takes him across America on another odyssey.Given that this is a sequel to the original 2006 BORAT film which Baron Cohen had previously retired in 2007; it lacks any freshness and this second BORAT mockumentary feature feels a little dated and tired. That the Borat character is also so recognisable also means that he has to go in disguise for much of the film.Nevertheless that it was made in the year before the 2020 elections in America and at the time of the start of the Covid pandemic makes for interesting timing. However; it is the verve and energy of Bakalova as his partner in crime here that provides much of the foil for the laughs and some of the most jaw dropping moments on the film. Although the more gross out scenes are more of a turn off; there are a couple of outstanding scenes worthy of note; such as Baron Cohen dressed in a Trump fat suit crashing a Vice President Mike Pence speech at the CPAC 2020 conference and most sensationally of all pulling off the honey trap against Rudy Giuliani in a hotel room leading to former New York Mayor and Trump loyalist declaring after the film's release that he was only "tucking in his shirt".The film has more hisses than misses; but some of the mere chutzpah needs to be seen to be believed.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6240064/?ref_=tt_urv
